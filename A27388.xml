            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>NEither the Author of the enſuing diſcourſe doth ſtand in need of any teſtimony from me, among thoſe to whom he was known, nor will the diſcourſe it ſelf need any recommendation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that ſhall peruſe it, provided they be any ways ſerious in Religion. It is therefore rather for compliance with the requeſt of others, then from any inclination in my ſelf, that I prefix theſe few lines unto what doth enſue. But yet I muſt ſay alſo, that the high eſteem which I had of the Author whilſt he lived, for the gifts and graces of God that were Eminent in him, and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the ſubject matter treated of in this diſcourſe, made me more willing to this compliance then otherwiſe I ſhould have been. I ſhall therefore offer a few things to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which he may eſteem or reject as he ſhall ſee cauſe. The Author of this diſcourſe (as is well known) is ſome while ſince entred into his reſt, and he is ſo, after his painful, faithful, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful labour in the Vineyard of Chriſt for above fifty years. And I ſhall ſay no more concerning him, but that as he was eminently furniſhed with all miniſterial abilities, ſo it is but a joint
<pb facs="tcp:99371:3"/>teſtimony of all that knew him, that his ſingular and almoſt unparllel'd perſeverance in Prayer, as for all other concerns for the Church of Chriſt, ſo for the ſucceſs of his own Miniſtry, was that which both ſtrengthened him to his work, and gave him ſucceſs in it amongst whom he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And I mention this only as an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a juſt expectation of uſe, and fruit from this part of his labours, in that it had an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſhare in thoſe fervent Prayers, wherewith all his endeavours in this kind were accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſubject-matter here inſiſted on by him, is of the higheſt importance unto all, whoſe deſign and buſineſs it is to live unto God. For it is not any one ſingle grace whoſe exerciſe is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor any one ſingle duty which is preſſed and exhorted unto, but the entire management and acting of the principle of Spiritual Life in our whole walk before God, is declared and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this diſcourſe. For in theſe things do our Souls live, in them doth their proſperity conſiſt. No Soul can proſper but in the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of all graces, whereby the habit of them are ſtrengthened, and the due performance of all thoſe duties wherein they are exerciſed. To have a guide in theſe things, ſuch a guide as evidenced himſelf went before every ſtep in the way, directing and encouraging others to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company and follow him in the ſame courſe and way, is of great concernment unto ſuch humble, teachable Souls, as deſign a proſperous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:99371:4"/>in the profeſſion of Religion, wherein we are ingaged. And the deſign of this diſcourſe, with the management of it, to direct unto a Soul's proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, have weight added to them from the ſeaſon, wherein by the guidance of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence they are now publiſhed. For we are fallen into a time, wherein the Spiritual diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, decays and thriftleſneſs of many profeſſors of Religion do evidence themſelves to the World, and complaints of the want of Soul-proſperity, is heard from the moſt who ſincerely inſpect the inward ſtate of Religion this day, in themſelves and others. It can't therefore want that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which ſeaſon gives unto a word of truth. The manner of handling both Doctrine and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this diſcourſe is ſuch as becomes both the Author of it, and the Subject treated on, for it is done with that gravity and ſoundneſs of ſpeech as cannot be reproved; with that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perſpicuity, which as it excludes all countenance from ornament of Speech, ſo there is nothing in it that may be expoſed to contempt amongst them that underſtand Spiritual things, or know in any meaſure, how they ought to be taught. And that which gives life to the whole, is an open evidence that the Author did both expreſs his own experience, and gives the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his own mind, in the endeavour after Soul-proſperity, wherein his attainments and ſucceſs were eminent above the moſt. And if the Reader be one who is ingaged in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:99371:4"/>deſign, he will find, that as face anſwereth unto face in water, ſo his heart will anſwer the heart of the Author in his expreſſions of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and practice, and it is nothing but the Edification of Believers in faith and holineſs that is aimed at, without the leaſt alliance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of thoſe controverſies in Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the profeſſion of it are perplexed in the World. For though theſe and ſuch things as theſe here treated of, are deſpiſed and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by Men of corrupt minds and prophane Spirits, unto whom the whole practice and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlineſs, with the manner of its Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the Scripture, is folly and matter of contempt; yet none have yet ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it will admit of a queſtion in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, whether Believers ought ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour the ſpiritual proſperity of their own Souls. But with ſuch as by whom theſe things are either deſpiſed or neglected, we are not now concerned; as for thoſe who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be found of Chriſt in peace, in what way ſoever he ſhall pleaſe to viſit his Church, or the World, the Seaſon wherein we live, the whole power of temptation, which we are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withal, the ſtate preſent of most Profeſſors, all circumſtances &amp; calls of Providence, do make the ſubject-matter of the duty propoſed in this diſcourſe, more then ordinary neceſſary for their more ſerious conſideration.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two things, among many others, both which are infallibly certain, and exceeding comfortable to all thoſe that live by Faith, and fear before the Lord. The one is, That the Lord knows them every one by name. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, That he hath a perfect knowledge of all their concernments; How it is with them, both in reſpect of their Souls, and in reſpect of their Bodies; and what they ſtand in need of, for the wellfare both of the one, and of the other.</p>
            <p>We have both theſe exemplified in this Epiſtle, written to one ſingle perſon, <hi>Gaius</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99371:6"/>by name. Who this <hi>Gaius</hi> was, whether it was <hi>Gaius</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 19. Or <hi>Gaius</hi> of <hi>Derbe,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 20. Or <hi>Gaius</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſpoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I think, be abſolutely determined. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis certain, The Lord knew well, which of them it was. And the Lord did know, that this <hi>Gaius</hi> to whom this Epiſtle was written, was an eminent godly perſon, one that had a gracious, vigorous, active Soul for God, in a weak and conſumptive Body. And upon that account, he directs his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>John</hi> to write this Epiſtle to him; that he might know, how much he did live in his Care, and what obſervation he made of him, and his Condition.</p>
            <p>This is a very great matter, that an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire portion of Canonical Scripture (as this Epiſtle is) ſhould be written for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and conſolation of one good man. But we may wonder the leſs at it, if we look a little backward, we ſhall find ſuch a portion written to one good woman; but ſhe was, beſides her eminent godlineſs, a perſon of honour in the World; ſhe was a Lady, That's the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>John.</hi> And that we may know, that in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, God is no reſpecter of perſons, we have a third inſtance of this, in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> witten in the behalf of <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> a mean perſon, comparatively. A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99371:6"/>he had been, and one that miſcarried in his ſervice, and ran away from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But now having a ſaving work of God begun in him, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> had good experience, he writes that Epiſtle to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> on his behalf, that he might receive him, not only into Service, but into Favour; not only as a Servant, but as a <hi>beloved Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Lord.</hi> ver. 16. It was a great priviledge, that God vouchſafed theſe three Perſons, above others. It's true, we find more Epiſtles written to particular Perſons, as two to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and one to <hi>Titus;</hi> but they were written on a more publick, and general account. And the ſubſtance of thoſe three Epiſtles, may be found in that to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He wrote, that he might know, how to behave himſelf in the Church of God, the Houſe of the living God.</hi> However, though this was ſuch a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with reſpect to theſe three Perſons; yet we know very well, that God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them alone; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Whatever is written, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning:</hi> what is written to <hi>Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in this Epiſtle, and what is in this ſingle verſe, is written for our learning: The Lord give us to learn, what may be learnt by it.</p>
            <p>In theſe words we have obſervable three parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Something expreſſed. It was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99371:7"/>well with <hi>Gaius,</hi> in reſpect of his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al condition. He was like to have a very comfortable journey to Heaven: His Soul proſpered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have ſomething implied, <hi>ſc.</hi> That it was not altogether ſo well with <hi>Gaius</hi> in his outward condition, eſpecially in reſpect of his health. Though he was a very god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, he was none of the ſtrongeſt men. He was weak, and ſickly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have ſomething deſired.</p>

            <p>It is not unfit to give you an account, in a word or two, of the choice of this Text. Ye may remember that the ſubjects of ſome foregoing Exerciſes were theſe two things.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99371:7"/>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning a dead Religion. Many Profeſſors of the true Religion, as 'tis profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them, it is a dead Religion; and their works, in, and about it, are dead works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We came to ſpeak of a dying, wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, languiſhing Religion. The obſervation was this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A living Chriſtian, yet alive to God (and that's all) may, in reſpect of his Chriſtianity, be in a dying, withering languiſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe what follows in that Epiſtle, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. did not give ſo fair a foundation, to build that upon, which I am now to ſpeak of, concerning a thriving, and proſpering Religion, I have made choice of theſe words. And the obſervation which I ſhall, as the Lord ſhall enable me, inſiſt moſt upon, will be this.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Doct.</label> 
               <hi>That of all proſperity, Soul-proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the moſt deſireable proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come to ſpeak of that Point, it will be requiſite, not only to ſhew how the Text bears it, but it may be convenient to point out ſome few Obſervations, which the words afford, which I ſhall, as briefly as may be, paſs through; and the firſt is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Concerning the perſon of this <hi>Gaius,</hi> who he was. I told you it could not be abſolutely determined; but it ſeems to be very probable, that it was <hi>Gaius</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99371:8"/>of whom the Apoſtle makes mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.23. That he was <hi>Paul's Hoſte, and the Hoſte of the Church. i. e.</hi> He was one that either Entertained the Brethren that went up, and down, to preach the Goſpel <hi>gratis,</hi> at his own charge, or elſe that he had the chief overſight of that publick houſe, that was for their entertainment there. And that which may well lead us to this conjecture, is that which we have <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; where <hi>John</hi> gives him this teſtimony; <hi>That whatever he did to the Brethren, and Strangers, he did it faithfully, and they bare witneſs of his charity.</hi> So that, either this was that <hi>Gaius,</hi> or elſe, as he had the ſame name, ſo he had the ſame diſpoſition. He was charitable, and hoſpitable. And this let him very deeply into <hi>John</hi>'s affection. He loved him dearly, calls him, <hi>His belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> (the ſame word is rendered, <hi>Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi>) and prayeth for him.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Note.</label> Perſons of publick Spirits, that do good with what they have, according to their ability; eſpecially for the promoting of Religion, are moſt likely to have, and it is fit they ſhould have, moſt prayers put up to God, for their welfare and proſperity, in every reſpect.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid <hi>Job.</hi> 31.20. that <hi>The loins of the poor bleſſed him.</hi> They had no bleſſing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of: but the meaning is, They heartily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99371:8"/>prayed for a bleſſing upon <hi>Job,</hi> and all that he had. We read <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. of a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, her name was <hi>Dorcas.</hi> She was full of good works. <hi>Peter</hi> finds a great many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Corps, weeping, and telling him, what good ſhe had done, whilſt among them, and ſhewed him, not her own Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, but the Coats ſhe had made for them. Doubtleſs, ſhe that had ſo many Tears ſhed for her, when ſhe was dead, had many prayers put up for her, while ſhe was alive. Perhaps, they were not like to find another <hi>Dorcas.</hi> It might be then, as it is now. <hi>All ſeek their own, none the things of Christ.</hi> All look after their own particular intereſt. Theſe are like to be, as that wicked Prince, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.20. who lived undeſired, and dyed unlamented. What will perſons ſay of ſuch? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.19. They will bleſs them while they live, in hope to get ſomething by them; but when they dye, farewel they. They were good for none, but themſelves. But it was not ſo with <hi>Gaius,</hi> it was not ſo with <hi>Dorcas.</hi> It is <hi>Calvin</hi>'s note: He thinks God raiſed <hi>Dorcas</hi> to life, out of reſpect to the poor people.</p>

            <p>We find in Scripture, that very much guilt hath been contracted, and very much folly expreſſed, by wild, and extravagant wiſhes. I ſhall inſtance in the miſcarriages of good people, this way. <hi>Job</hi> wiſheth that he had never been born, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Jeremy</hi> wiſheth that either, he had never been born, or dyed by and by, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. <hi>Jonah</hi> wiſheth he were dead, and as much under ground, as he was above ground, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>David</hi> wiſheth, that he had dyed for <hi>Abſolom.</hi> But the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt wiſh is that of <hi>Joſhua, chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9. He was at prayer, but forgate himſelf ſadly. <hi>Would God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we had not come over Jordan.</hi> He wiſheth, that God had never made good his Promiſe, of their coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> There is much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed hereby. Many perſons pleaſe themſelves, if they may have liberty of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing. That they might wiſh for what they would have, and have what they wiſh for, then they would be in a brave condition.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99371:9"/>A fond, and fooliſh conceit this is, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Who knows what is good for himſelf in this life?</hi> The words are ſpoken queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and we are to underſtand them nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. That is only good for us in this life, which is improved in order to our Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Now God can carry on that courſe to bring us to Eternal happineſs, which he hath choſen his people to, by adverſity, as well as proſperity. Therefore this is the duty, and wiſdom of the people of God, to leave it with God, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt chooſe our inheritance for us.</hi> Wiſdom is required to make a good choice in any thing. God is the only wiſe God, he will chooſe well.</p>
            <p>Note this farther. In three things God hath ſet us bounds: Bounds to our Faith, what to believe. Bounds to our Actions, what to do: And bounds to our Prayers, what to deſire, and what to ask. And why ſhould our Wiſhes be unbounded, ſince they are like Prayers? Idle wiſhes are, at leaſt, as bad, as idle words, which no man can give account of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. Many have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their death, and deſtruction, by getting what they wiſht for. They wiſhed, they might dye in the Wilderneſs, and they did ſo. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>Farther, <hi>John</hi> here wiſheth, That <hi>Gaius</hi> might proſper; <hi>John</hi>'s wiſh was a prayer to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99371:10"/>God for him. From hence we may take this note.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Note.</label> 
               <hi>The well-being, and proſperity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's outward condition, is wholly at God's diſpoſing.</hi> Pſal. 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, &amp;c.</hi> It is neither the care of the Maſter, nor the faithfulneſs of the Servants, nor any thing elſe, that can do any thing at all, if God ſay Nay. If God doth not make the houſe to grow (as <hi>David</hi> uſeth the expreſſion 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.) certainly, it will wither. The Eſtate, the Houſe, the Family will decay; and, in time, come to nothing. I note this, that we may be all ſtirred up, to acknowledge God, to be the Fountain, and Spring of all outward Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings whatſoever. And accordingly.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As we deſire any thing ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, that we take in hand, relating to our worldly affairs, engage God in all, that he may work with us therein. We have War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>in every thing to make known our requeſts to God.</hi> Phil. 4.6. In every thing, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſmall, engage God to be with us therein; and ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.11. <hi>Lord ſend me good ſpeed every day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As we deſire to proſper, ſo ſerve the Providence of God; wait upon him, and keep his ways, and believe his promiſes. <hi>David</hi> gives his Son this counſel; <hi>Keep the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99371:10"/>charge of the Lord, that thou mayeſt proſper, and have good ſucceſs,</hi> 1 Kings. 2.3. And he had ſo, while he did ſo. It is ſpoken of ſuch a perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Whatſoever he doth, ſhall proſper:</hi> It ſhall turn to good, in order to the furtherance of the Soul's proſperity.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) When the Lord is pleaſed to bleſs the labour of our hands, to make our going out, and our coming in, the beginning, and ending of what we go about ſucceſsful, give God the praiſe. Sacrifice not to your own Net, as that worldly perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.18. who bleſs'd himſelf: No, give God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though the matter be never ſo ſmall. <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2.18, 19, 20. <hi>Naomi</hi> being brought into a low condition (though ſhe had been a woman of faſhion) when her daughter-in-law had ſped well in gleaning; <hi>O bleſſed be the Lord,</hi> ſaith ſhe. Truly, this would be well thought of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee thy hearts deſire.</hi> When God hath given us our hearts deſire, we ſhould delight our ſelves in the Lord: And the Mercy of God, ſhould raiſe us up to rejoyce in the God of our Mercies: This would make every days Mercies to reach our Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>I wiſh, that thou mayeſt proſper, &amp;c.]</hi> It was well with <hi>Gaius</hi> already: He proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the beſt proſperity; but <hi>John</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he might be royally bleſſed. <hi>That
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99371:11"/>mercy might compaſs him about on every ſide.</hi> Hence,</p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>That though it be a juſt, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured truth, That that Man is a bleſſed Man, whoſe Soul proſpers, in what outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever he be, yet outward proſperity (Soul-proſperity going before) is a ſuperadded bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and may be ſought for at the hands of God, with ſubmiſſion to the will of God, for our ſelves, and in the behalf of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is without all controverſie, Though a Man's outward condition were as low as <hi>Job</hi>'s in the Old Teſtament, and as <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s in the New Teſtament, yet he is bleſſed, whoſe Soul proſpers. For as it is ſaid, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man in his civil capacity: <hi>In his beſt eſtate he is altogether vanity.</hi> Pſal. 39.5. He is ſubject to changes, none can tell what a day may bring forth: <hi>Here we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing City,</hi> Heb. 13.14. So it may truly be ſaid of a perſon, whoſe Soul proſpers, whatever his outward condition be, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together bleſſed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him out of thy Law.</hi> When inſtruction hearkened to, goes with correction, the Soul proſpers; he is a bleſſed Man. In <hi>Job.</hi> 1. we have a deſcription of <hi>Job</hi>'s proſperous eſtate: Firſt, it is ſaid, That he was a Man fearing God. But we have farther, as it were, an Inventory given in, of his outward
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99371:11"/>condition: He had ſo many Sheep, ſo many Oxen, ſo many Aſſes, ſo many Camells, &amp;c. Theſe were a ſuperadded bleſſing to <hi>Job.</hi> This is ſet down, to ſhew the praiſe of <hi>Job</hi>'s patience, who bare ſuch a change ſo as he did: 'Tis very true, a Man may eaſily over-rate and over-value his worldly eſtate. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, if Soul-proſperity do not go before out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity, outward proſperity is but like a Cypher, and ſignifies nothing, if a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure don't go before it: A Man may write a ſheet of Paper full of Cyphers, but all do not make One: When Soul-proſperity goes before, God hath done much for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. They have the Earth, they ſhall have Heaven. They have the Nether Springs, they ſhall have the Upper Springs; ſo that if it were asked them, as Chriſt did his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.35. <hi>Lacked ye any thing?</hi> They muſt anſwer (if they will ſpeak, as the matter is) as the Diſciples did, <hi>They want nothing.</hi> God hath not dealt ſo with all thoſe, that have ſhot the gulph, and are paſt danger for Eternity. Many of them are cut ſhort; yea, they may ſay many times, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.5. <hi>We have fiſhed all night, and caught nothing;</hi> Laboured hard, and caught not ſo much as a Sprat for their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. Many a Man that labours all the week, hath very much ado to bring both ends together, his Gettings, and his Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99371:12"/>The wants of ſome are ſo many, that they often know not what to do; and the wants of others are ſo few, that they want nothing, but to know how to improve, what they have. To know how to abound, is a far greater bleſſing then to abound. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.14. whatſoever God doth, is for ever. If God give a Man an outward worldly eſtate, it is for ever: What, to enjoy it for ever? No, things ſeen are but for Time: But in reſpect of the uſe, or abuſe of them, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Now, to ſpeak to that, which in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>John</hi> deſires for his friend <hi>Gaius, That he might be in health. Gaius</hi> was not ſick now, that's clear from <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. He did not keep his Bed, nor his Chamber, nor his Houſe; for <hi>John</hi> adviſeth him to bring the Brethren on their way, after a godly ſort: But he was a ſickly Man.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Note.</label> 
               <hi>Thoſe that have much of the heart of God, and live much in the love of God, may feel much of the hand of God; as in other troubles, ſo in long continued bodily weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they may be ſick, is no marvel, for they muſt dye; but we ſpeak of long, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued weakneſs: <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſuch a Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. It is obſerved of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that in his latter days, he was very ſickly, and weak, contracted, as 'twas thought, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99371:12"/>too much Alöes: <hi>Thuanus</hi> ſaith, he was ſo ſeven years before his death. We find, <hi>Job</hi> obſerved this in his days, <hi>Job.</hi> 21.25. <hi>One dyes in the bitterneſs of his Soul, never eats his bread with pleaſure. [One dyes.]</hi> What one? Even one good Man, as well as one bad Man: He ſpeaks indifferently of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; all things fall alike to all. The good Man dyes in bitterneſs, and pain, ſeldom made a good meal. Thus ye ſee it hath been: And I note this, only for this purpoſe; that we may ſee, that no new thing befalls them, with whom God deals ſo at this day; but that which hath been the lott of thoſe whoſe Souls have proſpered. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Gaius</hi> was very well with reſpect to his Spiritual ſtate, but he was weakly, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; therefore <hi>John</hi> prays that he might be in health: Hence note,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> A healthy conſtitution of Body, though a Man may be bleſs'd without it; yet in it ſelf is a very great and deſirable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: It is a comprehenſive bleſſing: It is the Epitome and Abridgment of all outward bleſſings: It is like Salt, that Seaſons every Meat. It is too true, this is not ſo feelingly acknowledged, as it ought to be, by thoſe that do enjoy it. But when (as it is in <hi>Job</hi>) a Man's bones are chaſtened with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99371:13"/>of pains, and a Man is worn away with pining ſickneſs; it is rare to find ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that doth not ſet an higher price on health, then he did before. And, verily, it is a very great bleſſing; whether it be by preſervation from ſickneſs; or by recovery out of ſickneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If it be by preſervation from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prize it as a very great mercy. It is left upon Record, as a very ſignal Providence, and gracious Priviledge, vouchſafed to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where there was ſo much Sickneſs, Plague, and Death: Yet (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.) there was not one feeble perſon among them when they came forth; for it is ſaid <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.27. they were able to come for thon foot, ſix hundred thouſand Perſons. And ought it not to be eſteemed at this day, in this place, as a great mercy, by thoſe Families which God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preſerve from thoſe ſickneſſes, that ſome are under? If ye do not labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this ſo, that God may not repent, that he hath ſpared you, ye do not well.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is a very great mercy to have health, by recovery from ſickneſs, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> judged it ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. <hi>The living ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks to this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.5. <hi>My Soul praiſe thou the Lord.</hi> He renews thy ſtrength as the Eagle: The Eagle (as it is ſaid all Birds
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99371:13"/>of prey do) caſts her feathers once a year; new feathers grow up again, and then ſhe is freſh, and luſty; and mounts up as high as before.</p>
            <p>Now that health, is ſo great a bleſſing, will appear in this, becauſe while the Lord gives it, he puts a very great price into the Man's hands, that hath it, to further his Soul-proſperity. A weakly, ſickly perſon is under many diſadvantages, as to that. For obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Weakneſs, long continued infirmity, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deprives a perſon of the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Poſſibly, ſome may, at this day, by weakneſs be deprived of ſuch Meetings as this; which we are to reckon publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, not in reſpect of the Place, but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.22. <hi>What ſhall be the ſign that I ſhall go up to the houſe of the Lord?</hi> while he was ſick, and weak, he could not do it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>It very much indiſpoſeth a Man for the ſolemn performance of the private Duties of Religion.</hi> We have a clear inſtance of this, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any afflicted? Let him pray: Is any ſick? Let him ſend for the Elders of the Church.</hi> Is not ſickneſs a great affliction? It is: Why then ſhould not the ſick pray? Sickneſs, and weakneſs indiſpoſe a perſon for the ſolemn performance of that duty.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Perſons ſubject to long, continued weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99371:14"/>of body, are often in much darkneſs of mind, apt to queſtion the grace of God in them, and the love of God, toward them.</hi> For ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and weakneſs indiſpoſe a Man's mind: He cannot infer comfortable concluſions from his former experiences of God. He is full of confuſion, like a skain of Silk, that a Man can neither winde, nor draw. So it is with an infirm Man. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.3. <hi>Heman,</hi> when his life did draw nigh to the grave, he ſaith, <hi>His Soul was full of trouble.</hi> It is a ſad caſe, a weak Body, and a troubled Soul too. Satan is very skilful at his work: He knew this, and therefore he reſerved this as his laſt temptation for <hi>Job,</hi> hoping that would ſtick, to afflict his Body.</p>
            <p>Now to Apply this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let all ſuch as God is pleaſed to bleſs with any competency of health, and ſtrength, keep their hearts under the obligation, that this lays upon them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. The Lord gave them Manna, to humble them. We ſay, Oh, if we were fit for Mercy, God would give it: Thus Folks talk, that never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be more fit. If we ſhould never have a Mercy, till we were fit, it would be long enough before we ſhould have any. God many times gives a Mercy firſt, and makes a people humble afterward. Well then, conſidering that life, and health, and ſtrength are given to every Man, for the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99371:14"/>ſame end, and purpoſe, for which <hi>Paul</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>To me, to live is Chriſt.</hi> Therefore we ſhould every one of us, while we are well, ſet about doing of that, which it will be very well, if it be done, before we are ſick; but 'tis of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be done, before we dye; even, what we have, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be found in Chriſt Jeſus, in a ſtate of union with him.</hi> If a Man be not in Chriſt, while he lives, he cannot live to Chriſt, nor ſhall he dye to Chriſt, when he dyes, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Christ in us, is the hope of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider then.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though health, and ſtrength be a very great bleſſing, yet it is a bleſſing quickly blaſted: <hi>Job</hi> obſerved it in his days, <hi>Job</hi> 21.23. <hi>One dyes in his full-ſtrength:</hi> God gives him no warning at all. Alas, (ſaith <hi>James</hi>) what is a Man's life? A vapour, a little warm breath turned up and down in the noſtrils; when that is ſtopt, a Man dyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider this: Say God ſhould give us warning; and do with us, as he did with <hi>Jezabel,</hi> caſt us upon a bed of ſickneſs, and give us ſpace to repent; yet times of Bodily ſickneſs, and weakneſs, are ill times to begin to look after a neglected Soul, and to do neglected Duties. Sickneſſes and weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes bring a Man under many diſadvantages of looking after Soul-concernments, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99371:15"/>25.35. God ſmites <hi>Nabal,</hi> he was ſick ten days, that was more time then many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have; yet he could no more repent then the very ſtone; his heart dyed within him: Therefore what we have, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.4. ſhould be lay'd to heart; <hi>The night will come, when no Man can work.</hi> Do the work, that God calls to, while it is called, <hi>To day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If ſo be, health and ſtrength be ſo great a bleſſing, then let all that do enjoy it, take heed, how they do any thing that may prejudice their health; and do, what God would have them do, for the preſervation of their health; and not ſtick at any due charges, ſuitable to what they are able to bear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of prejudicing your health.</hi> They are very much to be blamed, that will ride wind, and weather, to get money, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.25. <hi>The Body is more then Raiment:</hi> Health and ſtrength are better then riches. Much more do they tranſgreſs, that prejudice their health to gratifie a ſenſual luſt, <hi>For no Man ever yet hated his own fleſh,</hi> Eph. 5.29. I have read of one <hi>Theotinus,</hi> who was very much given to drinking, and had very ſore eyes; his Phyſitian told him, he muſt either leave his drunkenneſs, or loſe his eyes: <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>farewell ſight.</hi> He would rather loſe his ſight, then leave his ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do what may be done, to preſerve
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99371:15"/>health: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, Drink no longer Water, but uſe a little Wine, for thy ſtomachs ſake, and thine often infirmities.</hi> The poor Woman (<hi>Mark.</hi> 9.) ſpent all ſhe had upon the Phyſicians. This is worth obſervation: That we muſt ſo mind the wellfare of our Bodies, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of health, and ſtrength, when we have it; and recovery of it, when it is loſt; for the preſervation of the health, and well-fare of our Souls. It is an hard matter to do thoſe things out of obedience to God, from a principle of grace, which a principle of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inclines a Man to. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4, <hi>That they may teach the young Women to be ſober, to love their Husbands, to love their Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, for the Amplification of this wiſh.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the manner. It was heartily. <hi>[Above all things.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>It is the duty of every gracious perſon, to be hearty, and real in his prayers, deſires, and wiſhes for the proſperity of the people of God, and for the health of thoſe that are ſick, and weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks to the praiſe of them, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.4, <hi>That they loved all the Saints of God.</hi> Ruth. 4.11, <hi>The Elders ſaid to</hi> Boaz, <hi>The Lord bleſs thee, and this Woman.</hi> How heartily did the good Women bleſs God for their old neighbour <hi>Naomi? Ruth.</hi> 4.14. It is a rare thing to find ſuch a ſpirit. Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99371:16"/>doth narrow, and ſtraighten Mens hearts: Their eye is evil, becauſe God is good. Corruption ſtreightens, but Grace enlargeth a Man's heart. It is a brave ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>To rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and to mourn with them that mourn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve again, Who it is that deſires this ſo heartily: It is <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Diſciple, who preſſed hearty love upon others. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. And he expreſſeth it to <hi>Gaius.</hi> Hence note,</p>
            <p>
               <label>Note.</label> 
               <hi>It is the duty of every Miniſter to labour, to exemplifie in his practice, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he preſſeth upon others.</hi> The Prophet (<hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4.) ſpeaking of thoſe ſad times in the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> But they might reply, Can you do ſo your ſelves? And he anſwers, Yes. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18, <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, yet will I rejoyce in the Lord; I will joy in the God of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the pattern, meaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, according to which <hi>John</hi> deſires, this outward proſperity might be proportioned; and that is, his Soul-proſperity. Surely this <hi>Gaius</hi> was a very rare Man: It is hard to find ſuch among all thoſe, that bear the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name of Chriſtians. How many are there, Chriſtians in profeſſion, and it may be, according to ſome meaſure, indeed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99371:16"/>and in truth, who proſper in their Eſtates, and proſper in their Bodies? They are well, and lively (as <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.19.) but they have poor, lean, wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls. So that we may very well, in the behalf of many, invert the Apoſtle's wiſh; and wiſh that their Souls might proſper, as their Bodies proſper, and as their Eſtates proſper. If we ſhould pray for ſome, that their Bodies might be, as their Souls are, we ſhould curſe them, inſtead of praying for them: We muſt ſay, let their Bodies be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with noiſome Diſeaſes, and let them pine away, for ſo their Souls do.</p>
            <p>But it was not ſo with <hi>Gaius.</hi> Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <label>Note.</label> 
               <hi>Though a perſon of a ſickly and weak conſtitution be under many diſadvantages, yet under them all, it is poſſible his Soul may thrive, and proſper.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16, <hi>Though our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man periſh, yet our inward Man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here take notice, that when I ſay ſuch a Man is under ſome diſadvantages, I mean in reſpect of the outward Duties of Religion, but not as to the inward, and ſpiritual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as living by Faith, exerciſing the Love of God, and the Fear of God; and deſires after the enjoyment of God: Herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts true Religion. Wo be to that Man, that hath no more Religion, then can be ſeen.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99371:17"/>Religion is not all Outſide, the Lining is the beſt part of it. The Text bears the Doctrine (mentioned in the firſt place) thus, <hi>John</hi> wiſheth that <hi>Gaius</hi> might proſper in all things, as his Soul proſpered; we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him in ſubordination to Soul-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. <hi>John</hi> wiſheth that <hi>Gaius</hi> might proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in all things, ſo that his Soul might ſtill proſper. If <hi>Gaius</hi>'s Soul had received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, <hi>John</hi> had wiſhed him a great loſs: So that the obſervation is clear:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That of all proſperities, Soul-proſperity is the moſt deſirable proſperity.</hi>
            </p>

            <head>SERMON II.</head>
            <p>I Now proceed to that Obſervation I firſt intended, in the choice of the words. But take notice firſt; That the Text gives a fair, and full occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſpeak to it, though perhaps not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at firſt. <hi>John,</hi> ye ſee, wiſheth all proſperity to his friend <hi>Gaius:</hi> but this muſt be underſtood in a way of ſubſerviency to the proſperity of his Soul: Otherwiſe, he had wiſhed him far more hurt, then good. If he had wiſhed him any thing, that, in the leaſt, had been to the prejudice of his Soul. It is then beyond all controverſie, That as he wiſhed that he might proſper, in all things as his Soul proſpered, he would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that his deſire was, That his Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways might proſper. Hence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <label>Doct.</label> 
               <hi>Of all proſperity, the proſperity of the Soul, is the moſt deſirable proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Explication, three things are to be ſpoken too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the Soul is in its natural conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and what it is in its unregenerate ſtate by reaſon of Original corruption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wherein the proſperity of the Soul
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99371:18"/>conſiſteth, and when it may be ſaid to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What are the Reaſons, whereby it may be made to appear, that the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul is the moſt deſirable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, there are two things to be taken into conſideration, and to be ſpoken to apart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the Soul is, in its natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> It is hard to tell you, for it is a thing which no Man ever ſaw: But this I may ſay, that it is that, which the Scripture ſometimes calls, <hi>The Spirit of Man which is in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. Sometimes, and indeed moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The heart of Man. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26, <hi>My Son give me thine heart:</hi> The inward Man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The hidden Man of the heart,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. <hi>The Candle of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 20.27. And this I may ſay farther; <hi>That it is a moſt excellent piece of God's Workmanſhip, and indeed well worth the tongue, and pen of an Angel to deſcribe it.</hi> The Body of Man, though it was of mean extraction; made, at firſt, but of the Duſt of the Earth, and liable every moment, when God will, to tumble into the grave, to rot, and putrifie, and to be reſolved into its firſt original: <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt ſhalt thou return again,</hi> Gen. 3.19. Yet that it is a very curious
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99371:18"/>piece: <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of his Body, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. ſaith <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, <hi>That he was fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wonderfully made.</hi> When I think thereof, ſaith he, (as I do ſometimes) it ſtriketh me with aſtoniſhment, yea with a dread, and fear of the incomprehenſible wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and power of God manifeſted therein. This my Soul knows full well; yet this is but the Caſe, the Cabinet: The Soul is the Jewel that is in it: If that be as the Ring, this is the Diamond in the Ring. I ſhall not undertake an exact definition of it, but only this deſcription.</p>
            <p>It is a Spiritual, Immortal ſubſtance uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Body, yet exiſting, when it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body; capable of doing more ſervice unto God, and of receiving more good from God, then all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that ever God made, the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Human Nature of Chriſt only excepted.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the proof of the particulars of this deſcription. Some of them may, poſſibly come to be ſpoken to, hereafter: Only, for the preſent, take notice that it is endued with three moſt excellent Faculties, which will go far, if no more ſhould at any time be ſaid, in proving this to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With the faculty of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of knowing Good from Evil; Truth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99371:19"/>from Falſhood; of knowing God in Chriſt, the knowledge of whom is Eternal Life. <hi>Job.</hi> 32.8. <hi>There is a Spirit in Man, and the inſpiration of the Almighty giveth him <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Every Soul hath this faculty, though this faculty in every Soul be not ſo furniſhed, yet it is capable of the inſpiration of the Almighty, ſo as to <hi>know the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> and every truth, as it ought to be known; without which, Man were no more capable of ſuch knowledge then the Beaſts of the field; as <hi>Elihu</hi> expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>Job.</hi> 35.11. <hi>Who teacheth us more then the Beaſts of the Earth; and maketh us wiſer then the Fowls of Heaven.</hi> Therefore <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> upon the higheſt grounds of reaſon, praiſeth, and magnifieth God, for reſtoring his underſtanding unto him. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.34.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Endued it is with the admirable facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which hath a power to make a Man ſtand in awe of God, though he does not ſee him; yea, and of himſelf too, when no Body knows where he is, nor what he is doing. For it taketh knowledge, and can, or, at laſt day, will bear witneſs what a Man hath thought, or ſpoken, or done; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from his Cradle to his Grave: So that no Man need to call for a Candle, to ſee what he hath done in the dark. Though the darkneſs of the night may hide us from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99371:19"/>others, and the darkneſs of our mind may hide us from our ſelves (for Conſcience may be hardened, it may be ſeared, but it can never be blind) yet ſtill it hath an eye open, to ſee into our moſt retired thoughts, which no eye can ſee, but his, who ſeeth all things. And farther, this is a faculty full of power, that it can acquit, or condemn, torment or comfort a Man as the matter requires, ſay all the World what they can to the contrary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is endued with the faculty of the <hi>Will,</hi> which hath a liberty of chooſing what is good, and refuſing what is evil, ſo that nothing can hurt us without our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28, <hi>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul.</hi> Satan cannot make any of his Fiery darts ſtick, unleſs we will our ſelves. He did not by his power (for he could not) force <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the forbidden fruit, though he found her alone, without her Husband: but by his ſubtilty he beguiled her. It is true, he is ſaid to have filled the heart of <hi>Ananias,</hi> ſo as to lye to the Holy Ghoſt, but he could blame none but himſelf for it. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3.— <hi>Why is it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, that Satan hath filled thine heart, to lye to the Holy-Ghoſt?</hi> He could not deny, but that it was his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Devil only pulled the Latch, and he opened the door himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99371:20"/>
            <p>Theſe are excellent endowments: Now of a Soul endued with all theſe excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, in reſpect of its original conſtitution, in every living Man, even the pooreſt Caſt-out (like that infant <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5.) upon that account only, not conſidered as beautified with the excellencies of the new Creature it is, that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. That it is far more worth then the whole World. That the gaining of the one, would not recompence the loſs of the other. Now as we ſay of a poor child, idling and begging about the Streets, that is of a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, hath a good wit, and a healthy conſtitution, That it is a thouſand pities that ſuch a lovely, hopeful Child ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for want of breeding, and education. So we may ſay much more, and that upon many accounts, That it is ſad, exceeding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably ſad, that ſuch an excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Soul of Man is, ſhould periſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally periſh, and become the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing that ever God made, (next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Devil) for want of good looking to; and that the wellfare and proſperity thereof, ſhould never be minded. It were a bleſſed thing, if Men did but know the worth of their Souls, and value them accordingly: <hi>David</hi> indeed did ſo. He counted it his Darling, his only One, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.20. He was ſo choice, and tender of it, as knowing the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99371:20"/>wellfare thereof did ſo much concern him, that he would truſt none but God with it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. <hi>Into thy hand, I commit my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> But for the generality, though called Chriſtians, yet, for this, deſerve not the name of Men, that they deal worſe with their Souls, than <hi>Joſhua</hi> did with the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> He made them but hewers of Wood, and drawers of water, but it was for the ſervice of the Tabernacle. But they cauſe their Souls to attend the ſervice of the World, and that in the baſeſt drudgery; and to ſpend, and wear away their ſtrength, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proviſion for the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the pride of life. (But this I may ſpeak to, if the Lord pleaſe, in the Application.) Only, I would ask, Who is he that can think of it, without ſadneſs, that ſo noble a Creature ſhould be ſo baſely abuſed? That being ſo Spiritual in its Conſtitution, it ſhould be ſo Senſual, ſo Carnal, in its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations?</p>
            <p>This is all that I ſhall ſay of the firſt branch, of the firſt thing that was propoſed; What the Soul is, in its original conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Unleſs this be well conſidered, we ſhall never be convinced, <hi>That of all proſperity, the proſperity of the Soul, is the moſt deſirable proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I now proceed to the ſecond branch; In what caſe it is, in its unconverted ſtate,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99371:21"/>by reaſon of original Corruption. If I ſhould ſay no more then this, it were enough: That it is in as bad a caſe, as ſin can make it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt the image of God, the favour of God, and all communion with God; as it is ſet forth unto us, in that threefold Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. of the loſt Groat, the loſt Sheep, and the loſt Son. But this is not all; for what by reaſon of original ſin imputed, I mean the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> in eating of the forbidden fruit, and believing the Father of Lies, before the God of truth. This is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon every Soul, becauſe the common Soul of Mankind was then in <hi>Adam:</hi> And even for this, every Soul in its unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate, is a curſed Soul. And then far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon of original ſin, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and imparted, the very image of Satan is engraven upon it; ſo that it is full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, a very Seed-plot of all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. I ſhall farther amplifie this, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little, and but a little, of that woful deſolation, that is made hereby, in all thoſe faculties of the Soul, mentioned but now. Something of this had need be ſaid, and well conſidered of; otherwiſe, a Man will never be convinced of the abſolute neceſſity, of minding the proſperity of the Soul, above all other proſperities.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is undeniable, that a woful deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made in the underſtanding, for it is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99371:21"/>filled with vile, and unworthy apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and miſapprehenſions of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21, <hi>Thou thoughteſt, that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf.</hi> That he lookt upon the moſt notorious ſins, but as Human infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, for ſo the man ſpoken of there, did; not any light at all in it, to ſeek after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, in that way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may be found. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11, <hi>There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God.</hi> Full of Pride, and fleſhly Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it is, and contradictions againſt the truth. No more able to diſcern Divine, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Truths, as they ought to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then a Beaſt can diſcern the things of Man. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, <hi>But the natural Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> It is ſaid <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. to be a fleſhly mind: So that though every one be not born a Natural Fool, yet every one is born a Spiritual Fool. The moſt refined, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon is no better. Thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. that made ſo fair a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are ſaid to be fooliſh Virgins, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves with Lamps without Oyl. Thus the eye of the Soul is darkened; How great then (as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.23.) is the darkneſs of the whole Soul? So great it is, that it is wholly thereby eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99371:22"/>from the life of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No leſs deſolation is made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: As the Mind, ſo the Conſcience is defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. This is very ſad, if we conſider either the Office the Conſcience is deſigned for, or the particulars wherein the defilement of it, conſiſteth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Its Office. It is the Candle of the Lord, by which a Man ſhould be directed in the way wherein he ought to walk. Indeed, God having given it ſuch a power, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over Man, that nothing but God is above it: therefore it is, that though a Man may do that ſometimes, which is againſt his will, and againſt his affections, and not ſin; yet he ought not to go againſt his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though it be Erroneous, becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience witneſſeth for God; ſo that to go againſt Conſcience, though the thing be not materially ſinful, yet formally it is; becauſe the autority of God is contemned: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of Faith: for whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For the defilement of Conſcience, I ſhall inſtance only in two branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is defiled with ignorance: Such a thick vail of darkneſs is grown over it, as though it obſerves every thing that is done; yet it often moſt ſhamefully miſtakes Evil
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99371:22"/>for Good, and Good for Evil. I told you, that it ſhould be to a Man's actions, as the Pilot to the Ship, to Guide and Steer it right, by a right Rule, to a right End. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no light, it leads a Man down to Hell, when he thinks he is in the high way to Heaven. As a Pilot having loſt his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, or the uſe of it, in a dark night, runs upon the Rocks, when he thinks he is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Haven. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2,—<hi>The time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God ſervice.</hi> Act. 26.9. <hi>I verily thought, with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is defiled with ſtupidity, and unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2,—<hi>having their Conſcience ſeared with an hot Iron.</hi> It is true, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks there, of an habitual hardneſs, grown upon Men by long continued cuſtom of ſinning; till they ſin, and know not; till they ſin and care not: Yet it is originally in the Conſcience at firſt, and doth not ſo much come into it, as grow out of it; as that ſprigg of an Oak, which at firſt (when it firſt appears) is very tender, eaſily turned this way, or that way; but grows at laſt, and that by its inbred quality, into a hard and ſtubborn bough; ſo it is here. It is worth our obſerving to this purpoſe, that what the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 14.3. and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99371:23"/>53.3. ſpeaks of ſome Men, that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together become filthy, the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 12, 13. applies to all, in their unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate. So what is ſpoken of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of ſome Mens Conſciences, may be applied to all, in their unregenerate ſtate: for the longer they continue in that ſtate, the ſooner they grow to that degree of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, to be (as they <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.) paſt all feeling: Conſcience in their Breaſts, is, as it were, in a dead ſleep; it ſuffers them to live in a ſtate of ſin, and go on in a way of ſin, without any check, or any, that is to any purpoſe regarded; like a Serpent that is charmed, and neither ſtings, nor bites. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.25. <hi>And they ſate down to eat bread, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had caſt their Brother into a pit.</hi> In this ſad caſe is the Soul, in reſpect of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But in ſome reſpects, the moſt woful deſolation of all, is made in the Will. It is true that original corruption frets like a gangrene through the whole Soul, but the poiſion of it chiefly hath infected the Will. All that the Scripture ſpeaks of the hardneſs of the heart, and of the ſtiff neck, and the Iron-ſinew, is little or nothing elſe, but the obſtinacy, and frowardneſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of the Will. Much might be ſaid to this: But I ſhall inſtance only in this; that it is full of contrariety to the holy, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99371:23"/>righteous will of God. I would, ſaith God, and ye would not, as he often complains in the Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. This is the miſery of an unregenerate Soul: for the will of God is not only abſolutely good in it ſelf, but it is alſo Relatively good to every Soul, that in godly ſincerity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to it. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good</hi> (good for thee) <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.24, <hi>The Lord commanded us to do all theſe Statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our good always.</hi> So that the Will of Man is abſolutely croſs to the happineſs of the whole Man, in being ſo croſs to the Will of God. It may truly be ſaid of every Man, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtands ſo much in the way of his Salvation, as his own Will. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40, <hi>And ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> I might farther exemplifie this, in ſhewing how corrupt, and naught it is in all its operations, in chooſing what it ought to loath. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.10, <hi>The Soul of the wicked deſireth evil.</hi> Iſa. 66.3,—<hi>their Soul delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their abominations.</hi> And in loathing what it ought to chooſe. It is charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.43. That their Souls abhorred the Word of God; would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to come near their hearts, but caſt it behind their backs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.17. Neither is this out of Diſtemper only, as a Man when he is ſick may loath the meat, which he loves
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99371:24"/>when he is well; but out of antipathy, and inbred enmity, which may be mortified, but can never be reconciled. Nay, it is farther charged, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8. That their Souls ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred God himſelf; though not as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good, and the giver of every good thing: but as a particular good, and croſs to their luſts, and carnal intereſts: When it comes to that, then they ſay, as <hi>Job.</hi> 21.14. <hi>Therefore, they ſay to the Almighty, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> Of ſuch things, <hi>they are willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> 2 Pet. 3.5. I ſhall ſhut up this ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with this: That the will of every unregenerate Soul, is called, <hi>The will of the Fleſh, Eph.</hi> 2.3. And the will of the Fleſh, is the very ſame with that which is called, <hi>The will of the Devil,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.</p>
            <p>Thus ye have ſomething ſpoken, to both the branches of the firſt thing that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the explication of the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What the Soul is in reſpect of its original conſtitution. This is fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; otherwiſe it will be (I think) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to convince a Man of the truth of the Doctrine. <hi>That of all proſperities, the proſperity of the Soul is the moſt deſirable proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In what caſe it is, in its unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate, by reaſon of original corruption: Otherwiſe, it will be as hard to convince a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99371:24"/>Man, of the abſolute neceſſity of minding, as he ought, the wellfare and proſperity of his Soul. In reſpect of the former, one would think it were impoſſible, that a Man believing this to be true, and that his Soul muſt live with him, when he is dead, either in Eternal happineſs, or Eternal miſery, ſhould ſuffer ſuch an excellent thing to be loſt, and periſh through his own default. In reſpect of the latter, one would think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that ſuch a vile, ſuch an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing as ſin hath made it, ſhould ever come to be good, and proſper. And, indeed, it is beyond the power of Men, or Angels to effect it. The recovery of a loſt Soul is more pretious then ſo. But to this it may be ſaid, as our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.26, <hi>With Men, it is impoſſible, but all things are poſſible to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, to ſhew, wherein the proſperity of the Soul conſiſts, and when it may be ſaid, to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</p>
            <p>By way of Anſwer to this, we muſt take notice, that Soul-proſperity, comes under a double conſideration.
<list>
                  <item>1. In reſpect of its Riſe.</item>
                  <item>2. In reſpect of its Growth.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of its Riſe, and firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This muſt be conſidered two ways.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99371:25"/>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) Either as looking, after it, upward, without us:</item>
                  <item>(2.) Or looking after it, inwardly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If we look after it, upward, we ſhall find its firſt foundation laid in God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Electing Love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we look after it inwardly, within us, then we ſhall find, that it begins in that day, and hour, when by the word and ſpirit of Chriſt the whole Man, both Body and Soul, is brought into a ſtate of Fellowſhip, and Union with Chriſt. Which is done, and not done any other way (I ſpeak not of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Infants, dying in their infancy) then by obeying the call of Chriſt, to come to him, and abide with him, and in him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning our ſelves to him, to be ruled, and ſaved by him, in his own way: Thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's Eternal love, is God's Eternal purpoſe, to work in the Soul, in his appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, that good thing, which he knows, will put it into a capacity of proſpering, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9, <hi>He made known to us the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure, as he had purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> ver. 11, <hi>In whom</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>we have obtained an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi> This Eternal purpoſe, ye ſee, to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99371:25"/>do ſo and ſo, for to work ſo and ſo, in ſuch, and ſuch a Soul, is his Eternal love to thoſe Souls.</p>
            <p>The time when this purpoſe takes effect, is then, and not till then, when the Soul obeyeth the call of Chriſt. Then it is, that an actual Application of that good thing, which was intended, is made. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the Lord's dealing with <hi>Paul. He was a choſen Veſſel, from all Eternity,</hi> Act. 9.15. But then was not this good thing wrought in him, by the improvement where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Soul might proſper, untill he obeyed the Call of Chriſt: For till then, he was a Perſecutor of the Church of God, and that beyond meaſure. But when it pleaſed God to call him by his grace, and to reveal his Son in him; then, that good thing was wrought in him, according as God had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as he declares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>Immediately, he conferred not with fleſh, and blood. But</hi> (as Act. 9.20.) <hi>he ſtraitway Preached in the Synagogue, that Christ was the Son of God;</hi> for as he tells King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Act. 26.19, <hi>He was not diſobedient to the heavenly Viſion.</hi> Now, if ye ask what this good thing was, which he received in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this call, in improvement whereof, his Soul began preſently to proſper? I ſhall give it you in a word: It was a Heaven-born principle of Spiritual life. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99371:26"/>that hath the Son, hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> Then (as he ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5.) <hi>He was quickned, who before was dead in ſins, and treſpaſſes.</hi> Then, his Soul was in a way of thriving. As a Tree, when there is life in the Root, it is capable, if well ordered, of proſpering, and bringing forth fruit.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, that if we look upward, we find the firſt foundation of Soul-proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is laid in God's Eternal, Electing Love. But if we look inward, it is then laid, when once, we are effectually called, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling:</hi> That is, He hath brought us into a ſtate of Salvation; which is the only ſtate wherein the Soul proſpers. And there it ſhall proſper. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>And we know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them that are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> When this Call is firſt obeyed, the Soul begins to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for the Underſtanding begins then to be ſavingly enlightened. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9, <hi>But he that lacketh theſe things is blind, and cannot ſee far off.</hi> In that day of God's power, the Soul is made willing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. And then the Conſcience begins to be purged from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99371:26"/>dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. And this good thing, thus, in this day begun, ſhall, one day, be made perfect, in full and abſolute Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23, <hi>The very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly.</hi> So prays the Apoſtle for them, and is confident his prayers ſhall be heard, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who will alſo do it.</hi> He ſaith to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.8, 9. <hi>Who ſhall confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might now diſmiſs this point, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Riſe, and Foundation of this Soul-proſperity; and proceed to ſhew the growth and progreſs of it. But I muſt firſt ſpeak a few words, to prevent, if poſſible, all miſtakes by any thing that hath been ſaid. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but in ſome, that never yet heartily, and unfeignedly obeyed the call of Chriſt, what by one means, what by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they living under the miniſtry of the Goſpel, there may be wrought not only a fair Reformation of the outward Man, but likewiſe ſome inward work upon the Soul; and that in each of the three forementioned excellent Faculties, which have an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of very great tendency to Soul-proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but indeed come very far ſhort of it, as to the truth, and reality of the matter.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99371:27"/>
            <p n="1">1. In the Underſtanding, there may be much light in the things of God. We read <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. that not only one or two, but <hi>Many ſhall ſay, we have Propheſied in thy Name.</hi> Some think they lyed in ſaying ſo, as if none were partakers of ſuch excellent gifts in their unconverted ſtate, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is clear to the contrary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, — <hi>Thoſe who were once enlightened, and taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt.—If they ſhall fall away,</hi> &amp;c. Yet here was nothing really wrought, for the proſperity of the Soul. They had none of thoſe good things, which do accompany ſalvation. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>But, beloved, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded better things of you, and things that do accompany Salvation.</hi> Thus it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; they know much, but their Souls are not fully brought under the power, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of what they know: ſtill, upon the account of ſome luſt, or other, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of darkneſs, ſpoken of <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Will, there may be ſome light touches of the Spirit, inclining it to cleave to the outward and viſible part of Religion; together with ſome workings in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and outgoings thereof in ſeveral affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20,—<hi>the ſame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with joy receiveth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99371:27"/>it.</hi> 1 King. 21.27. <hi>Ahab</hi> rent his Clothes, and put Sack-cloth upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in Sack-cloth, and went ſoftly. <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>Seeſt thou how</hi> Ahab <hi>humbleth himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me?</hi> And theſe ſtirrings of heart may work ſome reſolutions, and ſomething may be done in purſuance of thoſe reſolutions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 36, 37, <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conſcience likewiſe may be ſo awakened; and ſo much may an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man ſtand in awe of it, that he dare not go againſt the light thereof. Thus was it with <hi>Paul,</hi> he was ſo exceeding zealous, and made ſuch Conſcience of obeying the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Fathers, that he durſt not but do as he did. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9. <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Name of Jeſus.</hi> And he had great peace in ſo doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, <hi>For I was alive without the Law once.</hi> So had <hi>Abimelech,</hi> in that he did nothing, but what in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he thought to be Lawful. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. For this reaſon, ſo many among the ſober ſort of the Heathen commended a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>All theſe things ſeem very fair, but lay them all together, and let one and the ſame Man be thus qualified in all theſe reſpects, yet they are not in the leaſt, any true evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99371:28"/>that true, and real Soul-proſperity is begun in them. For all the light in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, his portion, at laſt, will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs. And for the workings in the Will, and the Conſcience, though they may ſeem to be not far from the Kingdom of God, as <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.34. Yet all is but as the Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, which (as ye may obſerve) make many a leap, as if they would mount up to the skies, and then preſently fall down to the Earth again. Still, one thing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They are not effectually called: Nor, by all this, can any prove, that they are called into a ſtate of Union with Chriſt: Therefore they have no Spiritual life. This Underſtanding is ſtill dead, the Conſcience dead, the Will dead, the whole Soul ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dead: <hi>For he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. So that they are not yet in the right way of Soul thriving. As whilſt a dead Tree is a dead Tree, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proſper, nor bring forth fruit. This we may ſee in thoſe that had moſt to ſhew for themſelves: So much, that the Scripture calls it, ſeeking and enquiring after God: <hi>Remembring that the moſt High was their Rock, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 78.34, 35, 36. Yet there was no Soul-proſperity begun. <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. all this while, their hearts were not right; they were Spiritually dead. Therefore as ye deſire to find any Evidence within you,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99371:28"/>of the Foundation of Soul-proſperity: <hi>Give diligence to make your calling ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. This makes it ſure, that ye are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of Electing love, and that God hath wrought in you according to his purpoſe.</p>

            <head>SERMON III.</head>
            <p>I Proceed now to the ſecond particular. To ſhew wherein the proſperity of the Soul eſpecially conſiſteth: and when it may be ſaid, to thrive, and proſper. This is the principal thing, the Text, and Doctrine engage to ſpeak unto. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to ſpeak unto it, is exceeding neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: You may well remember what was laid down in a Doctrine, not long ſince handled. That a living Chriſtian, though alive to God, yet in reſpect of his Chriſtianity, and Religion, may be in a withering, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; as far from proſpering, as thoſe Trees are, whoſe leaves fall off, the boughs wither, and the root decays. It is ſo with many. As it is much talked on, that theſe times have brought forth many broken Merchants: So they have many broken, or almoſt broken Profeſſors. Good beginnings (it is too often found) are not always ſeconded with ſuitable proceedings. Too many are too like the New Moon in its firſt quarter, then it gives much light, but it is down again, and it's dark again all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99371:29"/>over before the Morning light. It was a ſad queſtion, which the Apoſtle put to the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7, <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you?</hi> It was a queſtion, with a very ſharp rebuke in it; and it withal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that no ſatisfying reaſon could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why they ſhould make ſuch a halt.</p>
            <p>Now in ſpeaking to this neceſſary point, I ſhall firſt mention ſome things in general, wherein the proſperity of the Soul conſiſts. And then ſomething, which may more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly demonſtrate the truth, and reality of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general. I ſhall premiſe; That as the firſt Riſe, and Foundation of Soul-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity (as to any poſſibility of Evidence, that ſuch a thing is begun) is laid in thoſe principles of Spiritual life, which are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by virtue of Union with Chriſt: So the growth and progreſs thereof conſiſts in their increaſe. As they increaſe, ſo the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Soul increaſeth, and no otherwiſe. It is poſſible a Man may grow in gifts, and be very forward in exerciſing them, and yet the Soul not thrive. It is ſaid of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> they came behind in no gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. but their grace did not thrive anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to their gifts. No, they were ſtill but Babes, and very carnal. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I farther premiſe this: That there is a natural tendency in the principles of this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99371:30"/>life to grow, as there is in the beſt Seed, that is caſt into the ground to grow, and to bring forth fruit according to its kind: For they are the Seed of the living God; there is life in them, and every living thing grows ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure, which the God of its life hath appointed. The Picture of a Child doth not grow: it hath the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions now, which it had twenty years ago. But the living Child, to which theſe principles are compared, that, by receiving kindly nouriſhment, grows, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, <hi>As new born Babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that no work of the Spirit is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for glory, but that which is growing. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, <hi>But we all with open face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a Glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> Gifts may wither, but grace will grow into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things premiſed, I come now to ſpeak (and that firſt of thoſe things in general, which are undenyable evidences of Soul-proſperity.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. When this thriving and growth is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal: The Body proſpers, when there is a healthy conſtitution all over: When the Head is well, the Stomach is well, and all the vital parts are ſound within: But in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99371:30"/>that have the Rickets, the Head is only growing, the inferiour parts of the Body being weak, and feeble: When it is ſo, we ſay; the Child proſpers not. It is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo with the Soul: It may ſeemingly proſper in ſome things, when it doth not really proſper in other things, or indeed in any thing. It was ſo with many in the Church of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> Their zeal was warm in externals, in a high and mighty oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt falſe Teachers, Errours, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, theſe they could not endure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.6. But it was not ſo in other things, in the beſt things, there was a great decay in the inward Man, in the vitals of Godlineſs, in thoſe graces that accompany Salvation, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, <hi>I have ſomething againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt Love. Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works.</hi> This is as far from true Soul-proſperity, as a Tradeſman from thriving, who gains by ſome one pedling commodity, and loſeth thrice as much in greater matters. The Soul proſpers, when it grows up in all things. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15. <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things, in him who is the Head, even Chriſt.</hi> It were endleſs almoſt to reckon up the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and proſpering in every grace. I ſhall therefore inſtance in 2 things, by the thriving whereof, we may take an eſtimate of the reſt.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99371:31"/>
            <p n="1">1. When the Soul thrives in thoſe two graces, which by experience are found to have as great an influence on the health of the Soul, as Natural heat, and Radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, (ſo Phyſicians ſay, and Reaſon ſaith ſo too) have upon the health of the Body. The juſt temperament of theſe, is that which preſerves life, and health, and ſtrength. So when theſe two graces, that of Faith, which is as the Natural heat, and that of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is as the Radical moiſture, are thriving, and growing toward their full height, then the Soul is in a very proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Faith grows, which is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, as it did, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3,—<hi>becauſe that your Faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all, toward each other aboundeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this growth is beſt diſcerned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it grows in depth. So as the Soul is more and more ſetled, grounded, rooted, and built up in Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23, <hi>If ye continue in the Faith, grounded, and ſettled.</hi> And <hi>ch.</hi> 2.7, <hi>Rooted, and built up in him, and ſtabliſhed in the Faith.</hi> So that the heart is fixed, and is at peace within, when all without is ſhaken, and the foundation of all Creature-comforts turned upſide down. As a Tree, whoſe Root doth remain firm, when the top doth ſhake. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3, <hi>What time,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99371:31"/>I am afraid, I will truſt in thee.</hi> He could keep his faith above his fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil Tydings, his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord.</hi> Job. 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> As if he had ſaid: Though I read a ſentence of Death upon what concerns this Life; yet I have ſomewhat to truſt him for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this Life. No danger, nor death ſhall beat me off from the holdfaſt of my faith in God, through Chriſt Jeſus: When it is thus, that promiſe will be made good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When it grows in breadth, ſo as it gives a firm, abſolute, unlimited aſſent to the whole truth of God, and receives the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God, as in one thing, ſo in every thing, which it apprehends to be of God; and that purely, becauſe God ſaith ſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Senſe and Reaſon, can object to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. So <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. <hi>But I confeſs unto thee, that after the way, which they call He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all things which are written in the Law, and the Prophets.</hi> Joh. 3.33, <hi>He that believeth his teſtimony, hath ſet to his Seal that God is true,</hi> (in every thing.) I ſpeak this of juſtifying faith, not only conſidered in its moſt eminent act, which is to receive
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99371:32"/>Jeſus Chriſt, and reſt upon him alone, for whatſoever may give a title to, or a fitneſs for eternal Salvation; but in its moſt full, compleat, and perfect act, aſſenting to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is hiſtorically delivered in the word; believing every Command, every Threat'n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every Promiſe, both of this life, and the life to come. So as whatever is recorded in the word, is ſo believed, not without ſome gratious effect upon the Soul. Obſerve it in four particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A growing, thriving faith ſo believes what is Hiſtorically delivered concerning the Creation of the World, as nothing is too hard for it. Although the things believed do not yet appear; yet that hinders not a full aſſurance of their future exiſtence; ſeeing the ſame power of God, which created the World of nothing, can give a Being to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath ſaid, ſhall be, when it ſeems good unto him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.2, <hi>My help cometh from the Lord, which made Heaven and Earth.</hi> As if he had ſaid; I will never diſtruſt his power for whatever I ſtand in need of, who could erect ſuch a ſtately Fabrick from nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) A growing, thriving faith believes every Command of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.66,—<hi>I have believed thy Commandments.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves them to be holy, juſt, and good, and brings down every thought more and more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99371:32"/>in ſubjection unto them all. Thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s faith growing, and thriving hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent acts of obedience aſcribed to it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he was called of God, to go into a place which he ſhould afterward receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> A hard tryal: For as it is in the Proverb; The ſmoak of a Man's own Chimney, is as good as the fire of another's. So that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was yet more hard, of offering up his only begotten Son, that is, of his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Son of the Promiſe, in whoſe Seed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, yet he ſubmitted to it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. though he had but ſhort warning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2, 3. He received the Command over-night, and went about it next Morning.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) A growing, thriving Faith believes the threat'nings of the Word; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief makes the Soul to ſtand in awe of them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.161,—<hi>my heart ſtandeth in awe of thy word.</hi> So Heb. 11.7. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Faith takes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the threat'ning: <hi>He was moved with fear, and prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe.</hi> This is not too low for the beſt grown Faith to act, nor be acted upon. God thought it not unmeet for <hi>Adam</hi> to make uſe of, in Innocency, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Job</hi> found it in himſelf, <hi>chap.</hi> 31.23, <hi>Deſtruction from God was a terrour unto me: and by reaſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99371:33"/>of his Highneſs, I could not endure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) A thriving, growing faith, with all thankfulneſs, accepts the Promiſes, and with all heartineſs relyes upon God for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of mercy promiſed. Reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the promiſe, when he hath nothing elſe to avouch it; when there is neither Senſe, nor Reaſon to ſecond Faith. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.17, 18, &amp;c. <hi>He believed God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth things that are not, as if they were: Who againſt hope, believed in hope.</hi> And being not weak in faith, he conſidered not his own Body now dead, &amp;c. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God, through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God; being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was able to perform, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, <hi>We walk by faith, and not by ſight.</hi> i. e. By the ſenſible enjoyment of what God hath promiſed, but by faith, believing, and waiting for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment: Notwithſtanding all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al improbability, and ſeeming impoſſibilities that are in the way: When faith thus grows, the Soul proſpers exceedingly. Now the heart will be kept more ſweet, and clean then ordinary, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9,—<hi>purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> The World will be Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, <hi>And this is the victory that overcometh the World, even your faith.</hi> And hereby Satan himſelf is trodden under foot.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99371:33"/>
            <p n="2">2. When Repentance grows (which is as the Radical moiſture) then the Soul proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Now Repentance grows,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When there is a growth and increaſe in the neceſſary adjunct of Repentance; in that which is as inſeparable from it, as heat is from the fire; and that is in an hearty grief, and godly ſorrow for ſin. This is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Soul may experimentally know the bitterneſs of ſin, and taſte, as it were, the Gall, and Wormwood that is in it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19, <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy backſlidings ſhall reprove thee: know therefore, and ſee that it is an evil thing, and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts.</hi> And it is inſeparable, for it cannot be rationally imagined, that a Man whoſe Eyes are opened, to ſee what great provocation there is in the leaſt ſin, as it is againſt the moſt high, and moſt holy God; it is impoſſible that it ſhould be without ſome pricking of the heart, as they felt <hi>Act.</hi> 2, 37. Now, when this grows, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſo as it reacheth not only Beams, but Motes, not only Camels, but Gnats; melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart with godly ſorrow before God, for the leaſt vain word proceeding out of the mouth; yea for ſinful ſilence, in not ſpeaking, when and what we ought to ſpeak: and for the leaſt ſinful thought in the ſecret
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99371:34"/>of our Souls, when this brings us upon our knees before God, and that with the firſt opportunity after the firſt diſcovery of it, as it did <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. <hi>And it came to paſs, that afterward</hi> David<hi>'s heart ſmote him.</hi> When it is thus, the Soul is in the high way of proſpering. For, what tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what watchfulneſs, what humility, what high prizing of Chriſt, are likely to thrive, and proſper in ſuch a Soul, when it ſees how it forfeits all its hopes every day, and therefore hath ſuch need of Chriſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, that the forfeiture may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Soul proſpereth when there is a growth, and increaſe in the Eſſential parts of Repentance, and they are theſe two: (1.) Turning from ſin, and (2.) Turning to God. Herein the very Eſſence and Nature of this grace doth conſiſt. To work this was the ſcope of the Apoſtles miniſtry. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. And this is that, which ſorrow for ſin (if it be godly ſorrow indeed) doth work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. For godly ſorrow worketh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) For the former of theſe: When the heart is heated with holy indignation againſt the leaſt ſin; and againſt it ſelf, for being, through its own careleſneſs, ſurprized by it, and defiled with it, as <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.6. <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99371:34"/>and aſhes.</hi> And when holy and humble reſolutions, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, are more hightened to keep himſelf that the wicked one touch him not, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. ſo as to leave any of his polluting impreſſions upon him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.3,—<hi>thou haſt tryed me, and ſhalt find nothing. I am purpoſed that my mouth ſhall not tranſgreſs.</hi> Pſal. 39.1, <hi>I ſaid, I will take heed unto my ways, that I ſin not with my tongue.</hi> Hoſ. 14.8, <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I any more to do with Idols.</hi> Iſa. 30.22, <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thy graven Images, of the ornament of thy molten Images of Gold: Thou ſhalt caſt them away, as a menſtruous cloth; thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) For the latter part: Turning unto God; it is evident, that this is an Eſſential part of Repentance. For every ſin, ſo far as it prevails, turns the heart from God. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14, <hi>Every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> Jer. 32.33, <hi>And they have turned to me the back, and not the face.</hi> Now the repenting ſinner, that prizeth the loving kindneſs of God as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then life, then life with all its fillings up with earthly comforts, cannot but ſet himſelf to turn unto God; as they did, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea.</hi> 6.1, <hi>Come and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us.</hi> Turn unto God, and that,</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:99371:35"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) As the chiefeſt good, out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned deſire to have his good will, to live in his love, and to enjoy Communion with him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7,—<hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou haſt put glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my heart, more then in the time, that their Corn, and their Wine increaſed.</hi> Pſal. 73.25, 26, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee. My heart, and my fleſh faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As our utmoſt end; reckoning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that therefore we live, that we may exalt him, and ſanctifie his holy name in our hearts, and pleaſe him in all our ways, ſtill endeavouring, that in all things our end may fall in with his. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11, <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto ſin, but alive to God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Rom. 14.7, 8, <hi>For none of us liveth to himſelf, and no Man dyeth to himſelf: For whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord, whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee when Repentance may be ſaid to grow; and that in the growth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Soul exceedingly proſpers. Ye have likewiſe, the firſt evidence of univerſal growth, namely the growth of Faith, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99371:35"/>Repentance; when theſe two grow in the Soul, which are as neceſſary for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Soul, as the Natural heat, and Radical moiſture are for the wellfare of the Body, then the Soul proſpereth. The God of all grace, bleſs us all with this proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: This is proſperity indeed.</p>
            <p>But with ſadneſs of heart, it may be ſaid of theſe two graces, what is obſerved of ſome Out-landiſh fruits, that though with much coſt, and care they are tranſplanted into this Countrey, yet they thrive not, as they do in their native Soil, becauſe of the coldneſs of the Climate. Even ſo it is with Faith, and Repentance, though they are much ſpoken of, yet they thrive not: Though in reſpect of their Root, they may be in the Soul, yet what through the coldneſs, deadneſs, ſluggiſhneſs, and unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiedneſs of our hearts, they proſper not; and therefore our Souls proſper not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they ever proſper, while theſe are neglected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed now to the ſecond inſtance of univerſal growth: and that is, when that bleſſing laid up in that promiſe recorded, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. is given forth; when the God of all grace is as the dew to the Soul; ſo that it grows as the Lilly, and as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars in <hi>Lebanon.</hi> The dew, ye know, is a very ſweet refreſhing moiſture, to the dry,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99371:36"/>and thirſty ground; which ſoaking into the Earth, makes it bring forth its fruits, and the fruit thereof to grow. So the dew of Heavenly influences, and Divine ſupplies of grace, when they fall upon the Soul, they make the Root of Divine principles to bring forth fruit, and the fruit to grow. And when it grows as the Lilly, and as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, then the Soul proſpers.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When it grows as the Lilly. The Lilly, ye know, is a very lovely Plant. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in all his glory, was not like it. Now, the Soul grows as the Lilly, when it grows in thoſe lovely graces mentioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, <hi>Bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long ſuffering. Forbearing one another, forgiving one another.</hi> What a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſight is it to ſee (ſo far as Man can ſee) a Soul clothed with theſe graces? Lovely they are in the eyes even of thoſe, that are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the life, and power of Religion; they cannot skill of the myſteries of Faith, of Communion with God, of the life of Faith, of the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt; but of theſe things they can judge, and cannot but commend. All commended <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that holy Martyr for his meekneſs; and kindneſs, even to thoſe that had wronged him, that it grew to a Proverb, Do him an ill turn, and he will be your friend for ever. So likewiſe, it grows as the Lilly, when it grows
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99371:36"/>in gentleneſs, peaceableneſs, and eaſineſs, to be entreated; when there is an ingenuous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, either to be perſwaded to what is good, or diſſwaded from what is evil, though in thoſe things that are contrary to our former apprehenſions, according to that in <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17, <hi>But the wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated.</hi>—This is lovely as the Lilly. Some there are who are guilty of that which is condemned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10, <hi>Selfwilled;</hi> that will not let go their prejudices; as if to change their mind in what they are once engaged, were a diſparagement to them. This is very unlovely, for this is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt folly, not to give place to right Reaſon. This hath not been the way of thoſe whoſe Souls have proſpered. <hi>David</hi> hearkened to the counſel of <hi>Abigail,</hi> and thought it no diſparagement unto him; yielding to the ſtrength of her reaſons, to alter his mind; and bleſſed God that he ſo happily met with her, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. It is Propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> When Souls proſper under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, they will be ſo far ſubdued, and changed through the Spiritual efficacy thereof, that thoſe who, by nature, were as fiery, as violent, as untamed, and untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as Wolves, and Leopards, and Lyons, ſhall be ſo ductile, teachable, and perſwade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99371:37"/>to what is good, that a little Child ſhall lead them, and prevail with them, to alter their mind, bringing Scripture and Reaſon with them. This is lovely; when theſe Principles of grace grow in the Soul, the Soul grows as the Lilly.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Soul then proſpers, when it grows, not only as the Lilly, but as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which are much ſpoken of, in the Scripture. Of all Trees, theſe ſhoot up higheſt, and endure longeſt: The Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof not being ſubject to rot, as other Timber. So that the Soul grows as the Cedar, when that deep, inward, rooted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to things below, which rules in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified heart, is ſo far mortified, that a Man's Treaſure is changed: We now lay up our Treaſure in Heaven, and ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things that are above, mounting up as the Eagles, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. Looking after the things that are not ſeen, as the things our Souls delight in, having choſen them for our portion; preparing for, longing after, and rejoicing in hope of enjoying them. When things that are ſeen afford us but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but matter of care, and grief, trouble, and ſorrow: When the Soul creeps on the Earth life a Snail, and is up in the things of the World, as an Eel in the Mud, then it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proſpers.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99371:37"/>
            <p n="2">2. When a laſting durable frame of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is attained, and preſerved, then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it grows as the Cedar. As it ſaid of <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5.21. That he walked with God 300 years together. So it may be ſaid, that our beſt works are at laſt: as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19, <hi>I know thy works, and charity, and ſervice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works, and the laſt to be more then the firſt.</hi> And that our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is nearer, then when we (firſt) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. But when good impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wear off, and hardly come on again, when inward meltings quickly dry up, as the morning dew; when the Soul is as it were ſick of the Staggers; now goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then goes backward, it is far from proſpering as it ought.</p>
            <p>This is all, I have to ſay to the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that in the firſt Riſe, and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soul-proſperity, as to any poſſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing that ſuch a thing is begun, is laid in thoſe firſt principles of Spiritual life, which are received by virtue of our union with Chriſt; ſo the growth, and progreſs thereof conſiſts in their increaſe, and then, this increaſe, where this thriving is, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, when growth in one principle is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to another, as when Men add houſe to houſe, and field to field, they are ſaid to proſper in the World. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.8. So when Faith, which is as the natural heat, is added to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99371:38"/>which is as the Radical moiſture, and the growth of the Cedar is added to the growth of the Lilly, then the Soul proſpers.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the ſecond Particular, As the Soul proſpers, when growth in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious principles is univerſal, ſo much more, when gratious principles are kept in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. The Scripture ſpeaks much of this, more then, perhaps, is taken notice of. For all thoſe commands we have up and down in Scripture, to love the Lord, to fear him, to believe in the Lord Jeſus, do not ſo much require the firſt principle, as the acting and exerciſing of that principle: As for inſtance, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. Commands the exerciſe of Faith and Love. We read of the work of Faith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. The work, and labour of love. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. The perfect work of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. Of walking in the fear of the Lord, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. Of walking in love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. Of walking by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Of living by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. All theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions note, the actual exerciſes of theſe graces, each of them being buſied in, and taken up with their proper work. This is of abſolute neceſſity unto Soul-proſperity. Bodily exerciſe may be ſo uſed, as that it may be a great means of preſerving Bodily health, but this is of far greater uſe for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the health of the Soul; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99371:38"/>elſe, ſometimes, at leaſt as to ſome perſons, may ſupply the want of Bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, ſo as a perſon may do well enough without it: But nothing can ſupply, for the good of the Soul, the neglect of the exerciſe of grace. Yea indeed, it is all one, as to Soul-proſperity, for the time, when it is not exerciſed, as if there were no grace in the Soul at all. We have many ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this, that it hath been ſo: when the contrary principles of corruption have choakt, as it were, oppreſſed, and bound up, the gratious principle from ſtirring, and moving, to make any oppoſition, to any purpoſe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6,—<hi>our iniquities like the wind, have taken us away.</hi> This we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> without any wrong to the memory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> I ſuppoſe it may be ſaid, that he had more grace, then <hi>Joſeph</hi> had, yet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> not exerciſing it, fell (as it is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.21.) among the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the Shield of the Mighty, wherewith he might have quenched the fiery Darts of Satan, was vilely caſt away, as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been anointed, with the anointing of the Spirit of God; whereas <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtood like a Conquerour in the hour of temptation, when it came upon him, with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and advantage. What was the reaſon of this, but that <hi>Joſeph,</hi> at that time, had his Loins girt, his Lamp burning, his grace
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99371:39"/>in exerciſe, as we find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9? But it was not ſo, in that ſad hour, with <hi>David,</hi> he was ſlothful, and did not ſtir up himſelf to reſiſt, but gave place to Satan. In a word, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was awake, and <hi>David</hi> was aſleep. Nay, at another time, <hi>David</hi> was overcome, when <hi>Saul</hi> reſiſted, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a temptation of the ſame kind. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.21, 22. <hi>David</hi> reſolved to revenge himſelf, when he took himſelf to be affronted by <hi>Nabal;</hi> with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. The Children of <hi>Belial</hi> ſaid of <hi>Saul: How ſhall this Man ſave us? And they deſpiſed him, and brought him no preſent; but</hi> Saul <hi>held his peace.</hi> We ſee by this, that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of much grace, avails not to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the Soul, if it be not exerciſed. It is, for that preſent, all one to ſpeak of, as if there were none. It is very obſervable to this purpoſe, what we have in three Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, concerning Chriſts reproving of his Diſciples, when they were ſo afraid of being drowned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.26, <hi>Why are ye ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> In <hi>Mark,</hi> it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe related, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.37, <hi>How is it that ye have no faith? Luke</hi>'s expreſſion, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.25. is in a different way from both: <hi>Where is your Faith?</hi> Yet here is no ſuch difference, but what is eaſily reconciled. They had a little faith, as it is in <hi>Matthew:</hi> No faith, as it is in <hi>Mark. Luke</hi> takes up the difference,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99371:39"/>
               <hi>Where is your Faith?</hi> Saith he: Their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faith was to ſeek, when they had need of it; therefore their Souls were as much out of order, and their fear as great, as if their hearts had been full of unbelief all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>It is then clearly thus: The Soul proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſo much, and ſo long only as grace is exerciſed according as the matter requires. This we have exemplified in <hi>Gaius,</hi> whoſe Soul proſpered, at ſo high a rate. Truth was in him, and he walked in the Truth, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. of this Epiſtle: In godly ſincerity, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. He walked with God as <hi>Noah</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. He walked humbly with God, as <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. And all that do ſo, ſhall walk with God in White, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. (as doubtleſs <hi>Gaius</hi> doth now;) an expreſſion that holds forth that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable glory, wherewith that Soul ſhall, one day, be clothed; yea, and their Bodies too, at laſt, when made like unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body of Chriſt. <hi>When his Face did ſhine, and his Raiment was white as the light,</hi> Matth. 17.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Soul proſpers, when, in all theſe things, it proſpers daily. One day after another; and one day as well as another; when more and more is daily done, and more and more daily received, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned particulars. This <hi>Paul</hi> could
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99371:40"/>ſay, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16,—<hi>though our outward Man periſh, yet the inward Man is renewed day by day.</hi> The Body of Man, though it be of as healthy a conſtitution as any in the World; yet it grows but to ſuch an age, then it comes to a conſiſtency, ſtanding at a ſtay; and after it hath done ſo a while, it begins to decay. But as it may be ſo, yet it ſhould be otherwiſe with a proſperous Soul. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14, <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, if that I may apprehend that, for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> It was now 25 years ſince <hi>Paul</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; for this Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> was written the ſame year with that to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> and both of them in that time mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.30, 31, <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>dwelt two years</hi> (<hi>at</hi> Rome) <hi>in his own hired houſe, and received all that came unto him.</hi> He had been ſo long a Man in Chriſt, done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much for Chriſt, and received ſo much from Chriſt, yet he is exceeding hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and thirſty to receive more (ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was very poor in his own opinion) that ſo he might do more, where he was called. Though perfection (as he well knew) was not attainable in this life, yet he aimed at it, hoping he might come nearer to it, then yet he was. <hi>[I follow after, that I may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.]</hi> What? Even that perfection which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99371:40"/>was then wanting. This was a proſperous Soul. I ſay no more to this, then as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid in another caſe to the Lawyer, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10.37, <hi>Go, and do likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Then the Soul proſpereth, when in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with all theſe, it is more and more Rooted in Chriſt. So as notwithſtanding all our growth in grace, and all our exerciſe of grace, the life we live, ſo far as it is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious (and it ought to be ſo, in all things) is more in Chriſt, and from Chriſt, and what we expect to receive from Chriſt, then in, and from our ſelves, when we think with our ſelves as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, <hi>Nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> Therefore intereſt Chriſt in all that ye do. Look unto him for aſſiſtance in every thing (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, <hi>I can do all things, through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>) and for acceptance of all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5, <hi>Ye alſo as lively stones are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy Prieſthood to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us go on, thus leaning upon our Beloved. The heart of Chriſt was much upon this, that all that are in a ſtate of Union with him, ſhould learn this, and live under the actual conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5, <hi>Abide in me, and I in you; as the Branch cannot bear fruit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99371:41"/>of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the Vine, ye are the Branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; for without me, ye can do nothing.</hi> And the more this is learned, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduced into practice, the more the Soul will proſper. It is worth our noting that true growth is noted by our growing in Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15, <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the Head, even Chriſt.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18, <hi>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As if to grow in parts, in duties, or any thing elſe, without growing in him, were a ſwelling, rather then a growth. The ſwelling of the Leg, or Arm, is no good ſign that the party grows ſtronger. It is thus indeed: whiles we are full of our own ſtrength, our Souls proſper not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9,—<hi>for by ſtrength ſhall no Man prevail.</hi> Therefore a proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, though it hath, and when it hath put on the whole Armour of God, yet it is not to truſt thereto, but to <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> Eph. 6.10. Certainly, the more deeply this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is engraven in our hearts, and the more we act according to it, the better it will be with us. He that laboured more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they all, that could ſay, <hi>He had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99371:41"/>his courſe, fought the good fight, and kept the faith,</hi> was he that ſaid, <hi>Not I, but the grace of God that was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. Happy are thoſe Souls, and more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they are like to be, that are ſo trained up in a continual ſenſibleneſs of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, as to what is ſpiritually good, that ſtill there is a looking up for more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that we may exerciſe what we have, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19,—<hi>and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3.5, <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting for Chriſt. i. e.</hi> into the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof. A Soul that would proſper, muſt pray for it ſelf. Yea, and for that which <hi>Paul</hi> deſired others to pray on his behalf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18, 19, <hi>Praying alwaies with all Prayer, and Supplication,—that utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may be given unto me. Paul</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a great gift of utterance, and memory, and had great experience of Gods preſence with him, in the exerciſe thereof, having preached ſo well, and ſo long, now twenty five years together, yet deſires their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not only for the continuance of theſe gifts, but alſo for the actual exerciſe of them, ſo often as ever there was occaſion of uſing them. And no doubt <hi>Paul</hi> did pray thus for himſelf, as often as he was to preach, and as little doubt there is, but that he did his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99371:42"/>work ſo much the better for it, and with the better ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Thus ye have, what I have to ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt thing propoſed: What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the proſperity of the Soul in general, wherein it conſiſts, and when a Man may be ſaid to proſper.</p>

         <div n="4" type="sermon">

            <head>SERMON IV.</head>
            <p>I Now proceed more particularly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that in truth, and reality, the Soul doth proſper, according to the degree, and meaſure, wherein the Soul abounds in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Soul proſpers, when it is full of Praiſes to God: So kept, from day to day, under the Law of thankfulneſs, that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in thankſgiving to God. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7, <hi>Abounding therein with thankſgiving.</hi> It is poſſible, ſome may think otherwiſe, that this is no ſuch great matter; but let theſe following particulars be duely conſidered, and I hope ye will acknowledge it to be as I ſay. Conſider then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though it be true, that there are ſome ſolemn Seaſons, which call for ſolemn Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when God hath abounded in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his love to us, and Fatherly care for us, in ſome ſpecial favour, beſtowed upon us, giving us to experience the truth of what <hi>David</hi> found, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.7. <hi>I will rejoice, and be glad in thy mercy, for thou haſt conſidered my trouble, and known my Soul in adverſity.</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:99371:43"/>Though, I ſay, this be true, yet we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der expreſs obligation, to make it part, and a great part of our buſineſs every day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>By him therefore, let us offer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Praiſe to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his Name.</hi> It was <hi>David</hi>'s reſolution to keep his heart under the power, and authority of this Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.2, <hi>Every day will I bleſs thee; and I will praiſe thy Name for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though it be true likewiſe, that there be ſome days when the Lord calls to mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12. Yet the ſaddeſt hours, that the all-diſpoſing Providence of the moſt wiſe God, brings us into, bring no diſcharge from this duty. Neither need we look for it, for theſe two duties are very well conſiſtent together. Otherwiſe, we may be ſure, that God, who gives a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſometimes to Mourn, would never have given us a command alwaies to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; if theſe two had been contrary one to another. And beſides, even in thoſe daies, when divine Diſpenſations call for mourning, when things go moſt croſs to our deſires, and affections, yet we have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Thankſgiving; if it were but for this, That it is never ſo bad with us, but it might be worſe. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth this to be a mercy, that he had leſs cauſe of ſorrow,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99371:43"/>then he might have had, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.27, <hi>For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he was ſick nigh unto death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me alſo, leſt I ſhould have ſorrow upon ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> Pſal. 118.18, 19, <hi>The Lord hath cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened me ſore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteouſneſs: I will go in to them, and I will praiſe the Lord.</hi> This needs not ſeem ſtrange at all, for even then, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God have very much appearance of contradiction to the Promiſes, and are therefore moſt ſadly croſs to our hopes, and expectations, a gratious perſon, if his Soul proſper, and be kept in a gratious frame, may, by the eye of Faith, foreſee the good hand of God, working even then, for good unto him: <hi>David,</hi> in one of the ſaddeſt days that ever befell him, as dark as it was with him, had a glimmering of this, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12, <hi>Let</hi> Shimei <hi>alone,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let him curſe, it may be the Lord will look upon mine affliction, and will requite me good for his curſing me this day.</hi> I can tell you of one, whoſe ſpiritual ſight was clear in this matter: One, that when ſad tydings were brought him, that cut deep, and went near his heart: Well, ſaith he, I will go, and bleſs God for that good, which, in due time, I believe he will work out, by the heavy burden now laid upon me. He did believe there would Honey be found,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99371:44"/>at the end of that Rod. Theſe perſons knew full well, that all things that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Lords Covenant people, are either bleſſings in their own nature, or are turned into bleſſings, in the Iſſue. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10, <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto ſuch as keep his Covenant, and his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> He always hath, and ever will ſo order all things, as that they ſhall all work to bring electing love, and glorifying love together. This <hi>Jacob</hi> experienced. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.36,—Joſeph <hi>is not, and</hi> Simeon <hi>is not, and will ye take</hi> Benjamin <hi>away? All theſe things are againſt me,</hi> with <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16, <hi>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bleſs the Lads.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> did hope to find it ſo, when his condition was very low, and his ſpirit very much ſunk, and fallen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye have the firſt Particular; that it is our duty every day. Though, we are ſometimes called to Mourning, yet we are always called to Thanſgiving, therefore we ought to reſolve with <hi>David.</hi> Pſal. 34.1. <hi>I will bleſs the Lord, at all times; his praiſe ſhall continually be in my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Soul is always habitually
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99371:44"/>prepared, and, as the matter requires, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in the actual performance of this duty; it is in a proſperous, and ſpiritually thriving frame.</p>
            <p>This will appear, if we enquire into the nature of Religious Thankſgiving. For theſe three things we ſhall find neceſſarily required to the eſſence of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A Cordial acknowledging of God alone, as the Supreme cauſe, and firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in all the good we have, of what kind ſoever it be; by what hand ſoever, it is conveyed unto us. This is neceſſary, for we ſhall never pay our Rent to him, whom we do not acknowledge our Landlord. We have cauſe to ſay of every thing, the leaſt thing we receive, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.23, <hi>This is the Lords doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) A real ſenſibleneſs that it is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty goodneſs of God, and that alone, that ſets his all-diſpoſing Providence on work to give forth any thing, the leaſt thing unto us, that may be any way uſeful unto us: And this, in conjunction with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, to live in the thoughts of ſuch a God, who hath all the World to care for, for our good, even the leaſt good. Thus did <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.10, <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of all the truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant.</hi> Gen. 33.5,—<hi>The
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99371:45"/>Children, which God hath graciouſly given thy Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) An hearty, and humble reſignation of our ſelves to live unto God, becauſe of his goodneſs unto us. This is the Law of thankfulneſs; and ſo far as a thankful heart lives under this Law, ſo far he muſt be able to ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21, <hi>To me to live, is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe thing are eſſential to the acceptable diſcharge of this duty; and ſo far as Men fail in any of them, ſo far they come ſhort in the due performance thereof. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly conſidered, it is very evident, that that work of praiſing God, ſo as to give him the praiſes due unto his name (as the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.2.) is ſo humbling, ſo mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſo ſelf-abaſing, ſo God-exalting; taking all from Self, and giving all to God; ſo heart-engaging, and obliging, that it cannot be otherwiſe, but that the Soul doth proſper, yea exceedingly proſper, when it is faithful therein. Read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. to the end: And 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. to the end of the 19th. And ye ſhall find in both thoſe Chapters, that <hi>David</hi>'s heart was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more after Gods own heart, nor ever did his Soul more eminently proſper, then at that time, when it was ſo warm in this duty. And this would be farther taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that we never read in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99371:45"/>(ſo far as I can find) that any, whoſe Soul was not at leaſt in a capacity of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, whatever they might do formally, did ever ſet themſelves ſeriouſly about it. We find <hi>Saul</hi> ſometime ſacrificing, and now and then enquiring after God. We read of <hi>Ahab</hi> humbling himſelf, and walking in Sack-cloth, but not a word of Praiſing God, either by the one, or by the other. No marvel; for pure need may drive a Man to his prayers: As <hi>Jon.</hi> 1.5, <hi>Then the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were afraid, and cryed every Man to his God.</hi> But it is pure Grace that makes a Man thankful (as thankfulneſs hath been deſcribed in its Eſſential parts) Formal thankſgivings are common, and with ſome, more common then formal prayers: But neither the one, nor the other ſignifie any thing with God, <hi>Job.</hi> 35.13, <hi>Surely, God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty regard it.</hi> A mouthful of words, is but a mouthful worth; no more with God, then a mouthful of wind. It is certain, there is no more real thankfulneſs, then there is a real reſignation of our ſelves to God, to live unto him. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy are conjoined.</hi> Though they may be ſomewhat diſtinguiſhed, yet they are not divided, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4, <hi>Neither filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, but rather giving of thanks.</hi> Ye may
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99371:46"/>collect from thence, that a thankful Soul, is a mortified Soul. It is true, we read that the <hi>Phariſee</hi> began, with, a <hi>Lord I thank thee,</hi> Luk. 18.11. but he ſtumbled at the Threſhold; for read over all that he ſaith to the end, and ye will find that he doth not ſo much praiſe God, as commend himſelf. I ſhall conclude this with <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19, 20, <hi>Speaking to your ſelves in Pſalms,—Giving thanks always, for all things to God, and the Father, in the name of our Lord, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe two verſes ſpeak fully to that, which I aim at: for obſerve the connexion between them, and ye will find the Apoſtle, makes giving of thanks always, for all things, an effect and evidence of being filled with the Spirit: Without all doubt, a Soul full of the praiſes of God, is ſo far full of the ſpirit of God, and ſo far begins the work of Heaven upon Earth. And therefore it is without all controverſie, that a truly thankful Soul, ſo far, and ſo long, as it continues ſo, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a proſperous Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The proſperity of the Soul, as it is very much promoted, ſo it is, and may be, as much evidenced, by the right Government, and due ordering of our Affections, of Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Diſliking. Of Liking, as Love, Joy, Delight, Deſire. Of Diſliking, as Fear, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Grief, Anger and Wrath. This is a large point: I ſhall endeavour therefore,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99371:46"/>to give you as much as I can, in a little. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Affections, eſpecially thoſe of Liking, were planted in the nature of Man at firſt, to be to the Soul, as Wings to the Bird, which make her flight ſo eaſie: So were theſe, to make our approaches to God, more delightful, that it might be as meat and drink to us, to do the Will of our Father. And ſuch a ſweet harmony there was in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul (whilſt he was as God made him) that he could judge of things as they were, affect things as he judged of them, and act according as he affected: Being made perfect after the Image of God, he had all his affections, at command, according to the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By reaſon of Original corruption, as thoſe noble Faculties, the Underſtanding, Will, and Conſcience (as I have lately ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you) ſo the Affections are moſt horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly polluted, and are become ſo many fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deceitful luſts. They are as another Antichriſt in the Soul, ruling over Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which ſhould rule all, under God. For as corrupt as they are, every Man, in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſtate, is led by them, more then he is by any thing elſe. For as they Affect, ſo they Judge; ſo they Do, what ſeems good in their own Eyes without conſidering any other rule, as they did, <hi>Judg.</hi> 21.25. till, at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99371:47"/>laſt, God give them up unto them: As <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 24, <hi>Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanneſs, through the luſts of their own hearts.</hi> verſ. 26, <hi>For this cauſe, God gave them up to vile affections.</hi> The caſe of ſuch is very ſad: For as it is one of the greateſt bleſſings, where grace is rewarded with grace. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.55, 56, <hi>I have remembred thy name, O Lord, in the night, and have kept thy law. This I had, becauſe I kept thy precepts.</hi> So this is one of the greateſt curſes, when God puniſheth ſin, with ſin, leaving Men to do what they will. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12, <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice; Iſrael would none of me. So I gave them up, unto their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To mortifie the inordinacy of theſe Affections, that they may be fixed upon their proper Objects. So as to Love, what they ought to love, and Hate what they ought to hate, &amp;c. To keep them ſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they be not moved, but when there is cauſe; and when there is cauſe, not without meaſure. To do this, is one of the greateſt, and hardeſt works, that a Chriſtian hath to do. It is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24, <hi>And they that are Chriſt's have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts. i.e.</hi> They are about it, and make it their daily work, and the better ſucceſs they have in this work, the more their Soul proſpers.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:99371:47"/>
            <p>It is ſaid <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32, <hi>He that is ſlow to anger, is better then the Mighty: and he that ruleth his ſpirit, then he that taketh a City.</hi> Not, he that is never angry (for the anger of the new Creature is a duty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26, <hi>Be angry, and ſin not)</hi> but, he that is ſlow to anger, is of greater excellency then he that conquers a City. He is more ſet by in the ſight of God, for the ſtrength of his Soul, whereby he conquers himſelf, then ever any Man was, or will be for his Bodily ſtrength, whereby he conquers others. It is more honourable to be a <hi>Paul,</hi> then an <hi>Alexander, Prov.</hi> 14.29, <hi>He that is ſlow to wrath, is of great underſtanding: but he that is haſty of ſpirit, exalteth folly.</hi> He that is ſlow to wrath, is a Man of underſtanding; much reſolution being requiſite, to keep that, or any other affection, eſpecially when it is ſtirred, within its due bounds, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Who is a wiſe Man, and endued with knowledge amongst you? let him ſhew out of a good converſation, his words with meekneſs of wiſdom.</hi> And great need there is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe this wiſdom, when occaſions are given, which may kindle that affection, to preſerve the ſpirit, in a meek and quiet frame. For as ſanctified affections are as a gentle wind to the Soul, whereby it moves aright to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, with a calm, and well-compoſed warmth, in every duty. So unruly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99371:48"/>are as a ſtorm, a very Hurricane to the Soul; ſo as like a River, in a great tempeſt, the Banks are over-flown, and much mud, and ſlime are left behind. He that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the riſing of ſuch a ſtorm, or can ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allay it, is a Man of underſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Soul is then ſpiritually thriving, and proſperous, when the inordinacy of the affections is mortified, ſo as,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Every affection acts as a ſaving grace in the Soul, when the affection of Love, is renewed by the ſpirit of God, into the grace of love, and ſo fixed upon God in Chriſt, that other things are reſpected only in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination thereunto: When the affection of Fear is renewed into the grace of Fear, ſo as to keep the heart under an holy awe of God, as <hi>David</hi>'s was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.161,— <hi>My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy word.</hi> So when the affection of ſorrow is renewed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grace of ſorrow; into that godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, which the Apoſtle ſaith, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. In a word, when Love, Joy, and Delight open the heart unto God, as unto the chiefeſt good; and Fear, Grief and Sorrow, ſhut the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, as the greateſt evil.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) When that which is unmortified (as ſtill ſomething of the fleſh remains in them, when they are ſanctified) is ſo far ſubdued
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99371:48"/>by that which is wrought by the ſpirit in them, that they are kept in a ſuitable ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, to all the Diſpenſations of God to every Providence, wherewith we are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; rejoicing, when he would have us to rejoice, and as he would have us to rejoice: Mourning, when he calls us to mourning, and as he would have us to mourn: Being angry, when God would have us to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and ſo far as he would have us to be angry: Angry as Chriſt was, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5, <hi>And when he looked round about them with anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts.</hi> When this is the buſineſs the Soul labours in, and ſtrives to attain unto, more and more, and is really humbled before God, when any defects are obſerved, and pardon pleaded, and reſolutions increaſed in the ſtrength of Chriſt, to keep a ſtricter watch for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, The Soul, at leaſt, begins to thrive.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) When though we let out our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this, or that, as ſometimes we may lawfully do, and in duty ought to do, about the things of this life, and what concerns us in our outward condition, yet we can take them off again, as the matter requires; as when we are to addreſs our ſelves to God, in any act of worſhip. This is hard work. <hi>Moſes</hi> was very angry, as there was cauſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19, &amp;c. But it was the morrow after, before he prayed for them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.31
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99371:49"/>But when we can do with our affections, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did with his Servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. Leave them at the foot of the hill, when we go to be with God, in the Mount. The more, and oftener, this is done, the more and better the Soul proſpers. I ſhall conclude all that I have to ſay in this matter, with this, which every one of you, that have any ſpiritual experience, what it is to converſe with God, will acknowledge: That the Soul proſpers, according to its Communion with God; and Communion with God, on our part is both preſerved, maintained, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, by the well governing and exerciſing of ſanctified affections, of Love, Fear, Joy, and Sorrow, Truſt and Deſire. Theſe are the motions of the Will, and the out-goings of the Heart: As 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8, <hi>Being affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Goſpel of God only, but our own Soul, becauſe ye were dear unto us.</hi> They are ſaid alſo to be the Feet of the Soul. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1, <hi>Keep thy foot, when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God. i.e.</hi> See, that thy heart be fixed, and thy affections compoſed. By theſe, the Soul draws nigh to God in Chriſt, cloſeth with him, and abides in him from day to day. And the more it doth ſo, the more it proſpers; for God draws nigh to ſuch, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8, <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> And he never comes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99371:49"/>empty handed. If the Father go out to meet the repenting, returning Prodigal; the poor young Man finds the affection of a Father: Therefore what S. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, of bridling the tongue, is true alſo of governing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: He is a perfect Man, he can bridle the whole Body. And after this perfection we ſhould ſtrive, as ever we deſire that our Souls ſhould proſper.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the ſecond Particular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Soul proſpers, when the principles of ſpiritual life are ſo kept in exerciſe, that in times of doubtful expectation, we can caſt upon all events, with an humble reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all into the hands of God, being willing to ſubmit to his determination, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. And when the matter is out of doubt, ſo as the evil which we feared, and perhaps worſe, is actually upon us, and a ſentence of death and deſolation is paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Creature comforts, we can then find reſt, and ſatisfaction in the exerciſe of faith on the promiſes of God. Here two things are to be conſidered. A little to each of them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When in times of doubtful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as beſides what any one of us may be in, with reſpect to his own particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we are all of us in, upon a publick account, we can caſt upon all events, with an humble reſignation of all into the hands
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99371:50"/>of God, and with a willing mind ſubmit to his determination. Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. If ye read the Chapter, and conſider the ſtory, ye will acknowledge it was a time of great ſadneſs: he could not but be full of fear, of what might befall him, God was now reckoning with him for his ſin; ſo he had reaſon to think. His own Son, and a great Body of his people were up in Arms againſt him: He was at great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, what God would do with him: He fore caſt, what might be, this way, and that way; and not being able to foreſee the event, he refers all to God's diſpoſing; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all his troubled thoughts, fears, and doubts with him. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26. If not ſo, then thus. If ſo, then ſo. He is in either way at a point. <hi>Here I am, let him do</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what he pleaſeth.</hi> This was a Heaven-born frame of Spirit, to be able to periſh, and to be undone in his outward condition, if God would have it ſo. Such a Man may be beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared and butchered, ſooner then hurt. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David</hi>'s Soul now proſpered; for never was his Kingdom more ſhaken; yet never was his heart more fixed. It was not ſo with <hi>David,</hi> at all times. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1, <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſaid in his heart, I ſhall now periſh one day, by the hand of</hi> Saul.—Pſal. 73.2, <hi>But as for me, my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt.</hi> verſ. 13, <hi>Verily, I have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99371:50"/>cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocence.</hi> He was upon the point of repenting, that ever he had repented. This is not to be marvelled at, though it be to be lamented; as (if the Lord will) I may ſhew in the Application of the point, That it is a rare ſight, and ſeldom, or never ſeen, that any Man's Soul proſperity is always alike. Thus much of the firſt Particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the matter is out of doubt, and as bad, or worſe, then what we feared is come upon us, yet that Soul is in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous frame, that can even then, in that dark, and ſad hour, find ſufficient ſatisfaction in the exerciſe of faith, in the promiſes of God, as <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4,—<hi>but the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Then, even then, when the ſpirits of other Men, in the like caſe with him, fail and ſink, and even dye within them, he is upheld in comfort: When his faith is unto him, like the Cork that is upon the Net; though the Lead on the one ſide, ſink it down, yet the Cork on the other ſide, keeps it up. When the eye of faith looks upward, and ſees the hand of the only-wiſe God, in all that befalls him, who makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing beautiful in his time; a righteous God, and can do no wrong; a good God, and will do no harm, when faith believes all this, that it is but to humble him, and try him, and to do him good in the latter end:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99371:51"/>As <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. And ſees love, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all, and hopes to find, what <hi>David</hi> found, and thankfully acknowledged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75, <hi>I know that thy judgments are right, and that thou, in faithfulneſs, haſt afflicted me.</hi> That in all the trouble that came upon him, God was therein faithful to the intereſt of his Soul, (a thing, which without much difficulty may be obtained of reaſon) to bear up under all, whilſt we are perſwaded, that all is done, in love, and faithfulneſs for our good. As for inſtance, though it troubles a Man to be in a Town, and forced to ſtay there, when it is beſieged by a potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet the ſame Man can be content, when need requires, that his Phyſician ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him to his Chamber, becauſe he believes, that he doth it out of love and care for his health. And ſurely, thoſe Souls, who when they are under the laſh of Divine Rods, and are toſſed with ſtorms, and tempeſts (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more then any they know of) can thus exerciſe their faith, and find ſatisfaction in the promiſes of God, ſo as to rejoice in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in hope of a good iſſue, ſurely they are proſperous Souls. Thus the Soul of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> proſpered, when he exemplified his own Doctrine, That the juſt ſhould live by faith, in the time of the Invaſion of the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> by his own practice, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18, <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99371:51"/>
               <hi>Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> It is obſervable, what I have read to this purpoſe (<hi>Magdeburg. Cent.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) that when <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> came into <hi>France, Lupus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troges,</hi> met him, and asked him who he was, that made ſuch ſpoil, and devaſtations in the World: He anſwered, <hi>Dei ſe eſſe flagellum;</hi> That he was the ſcourge of God, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he commanded the City-Gates to be ſet open unto him, and welcomed him with theſe words, <hi>Fauſtè ingrediatur flagellum Dei,</hi> Whilſt the Rod is in Gods hand, there is no danger. If this were ſo (as it related by good Authors) the Mans heart was in a good frame: his faith was above his fears: This is the third Particular.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Soul proſpers, when grace is ſo exerciſed, that it grows more and more clear in point of Covenant-intereſt.</p>
            <p>Obſerve here, theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When it grows into ſuch a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hope, and comfortable apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, as, ordinarily, it prevails over fears, and doubts, though it doth not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilence them, nor free the Soul from them. This is that, which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>The joy of Faith, Phil.</hi> 1.25. Ariſing from the ſolid ſatisfaction, which the heart receives, by a firm adhering to Chriſt, in whom all full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells, for perfecting the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99371:52"/>and Salvation, who is a faithful, and merciful High Prieſt, and able to ſave, to the uttermoſt, all thoſe that come to God by him. This is ſurely Soul proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Much more when the joy of faith, grows into the joy of ſpiritual Senſe, which is called, <hi>Full joy,</hi> Joh. 16.24.—<hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive, that you joy may be full.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.4, <hi>Theſe things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</hi> When the love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. When the ſpirit doth tell us a thing in the Ear (as the expreſſion is 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.15. It is ſaid there, <hi>The Lord told</hi> Samuel <hi>in his Ear.</hi>) that we are ſealed to the day of Redemption, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto us our Adoption; ſo as the Soul knows it is no deluſion, but the very voice of the Spirit of God; as <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that it was God himſelf, that ſpake to him, and commanded him, to go and ſacrifice his Son, and no temptation from Satan; ſo as the Soul can ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. <hi>Return to thy reſt, O my Soul, the Lord hath dealt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with thee.</hi> Now I ſee, the inviſible God is my God. All the Greatneſs and Goodneſs, all the Truth and Faithfulneſs, all the Power and Wiſdom, yea all the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice of the Eternal and Ever-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, are the things which are the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Soul. Now I ſee that all the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99371:52"/>Eternal counſels of God, wrought from all Eternity, to make me Eternally happy. Now I know that Jeſus Chriſt came from the boſom of the Father for me, and my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That my ſins are put upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and his righteouſneſs is put upon my account. Now I know my place, where I ſhall ſtand, in the great day of the Lord; even at the right hand of my Saviour, and hear that joyful ſentence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi> This is, in ſome ſenſe, I think, the uttermoſt hight of the Souls proſperity.</p>
            <p>For when ever the Soul is thus high, in point of Comfort, it is as high in point of Holineſs. Whilſt this continues, the Soul can do, and ſuffer any thing for God, which he calls unto. As the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> whilſt they knew their intereſt in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34,—<hi>Ye took joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſpoiling of your Goods, knowing in your ſelves, that ye have in Heaven, a better, and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> The heart being thus enlarged, it goes not a foot-pace, but runs the way of Gods Commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32, <hi>I will run the way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.</hi> That which we have <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. is clear to this purpoſe. The Apoſtle prays, on their behalf, that they might know the breadth, and length, and depth, and highth of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99371:53"/>love of God. And why did he pray ſo? It was that they might be filled with all the fullneſs of God; according to the uttermoſt meaſure attainable in this life, and in full, and abſolute perfection in the life to come.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you all that I ſhall ſay, concerning thoſe things, which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly demonſtrate the truth, and reality of the Souls proſperity: Only I deſire to leave theſe two things with you, in the concluſion, to prevent miſtakes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That none ought to argue againſt themſelves, that their Souls do not proſper, becauſe, as yet they come ſhort, it may be, at ſometimes altogether ſhort of what hath been laid down in this fifth and laſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. They are ſeldom ſo clear in point of their Covenant intereſt, as to feel the joy of Faith, much leſs the joy of Senſe. To endeavour to be clear in this matter is every ones duty. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, <hi>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your calling, and election ſure.</hi> To attain it is part of our Reward. But when it is not attained, yet the Soul may be thriving, and proſpering, for all that. <hi>Moſes</hi> his face did ſhine, and he did not know it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.19. This was at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond being with God in the Mount: We read of no ſuch thing, at the firſt time. We may ſee by this, that God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf in the ſame meaſure, at all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99371:53"/>times alike, to any of his Servants. It hath been ſo of old, and is ſo now. Many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take much of the quickening preſence of God, when they have but little, or none at all of the comforting preſence of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10, <hi>Who is among you, that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his Servant, that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light?</hi> &amp;c. Hence it is, that they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as ſadly complain as <hi>Zion</hi> did, (but all without cauſe.) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>But</hi> Zion <hi>ſaid the Lord hath forſaken me; and my Lord hath forgotten me. q. d.</hi> I am caſt out of his love, not only forſaken, but forgotten: when it was neither ſo, nor ſo, as ye ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, <hi>Can a Woman forſake her ſucking Child?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though all that hath been hitherto ſaid, concerning Soul-proſperity, are ſuch things, as are wrought in, and laid up in the hidden Man of the heart: yet theſe things are in the Soul, as the Candle in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, to ſhine forth in a holy, and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſation; and in the conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the viſible part of Religion, and that in conjunction with others, as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered. For though frequency therein, doth not infallibly prove, that the Soul doth proſper; yet in the neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Soul never did, nor will proſper. We read <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.24, 25. What a very bad
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99371:54"/>frame did grow upon the Soul of <hi>Thomas,</hi> by the neglect of one good meeting. Whether it was out of too much fear, of what miſchief might befall him, from the Council that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his Lord, and Maſter; or from too much care to ſettle his own private concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is hard to determine; but certain it is, that his Soul was thereby brought into a ſad condition. Therefore, as we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, we ſhould attend daily at the gates of Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. <hi>He that refuſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own Soul,</hi> Prov. 15.32. It is no eaſie matter for a Man to proſper in the World. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4, <hi>He becometh poor, that dealeth with a ſlack hand:</hi> So it is here; therefore as <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9, <hi>Keep thy Soul diligently, leſt thou forget.—</hi>

            <p>I Now proceed to the third and laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: The reaſons for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth of the Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is this. Soul proſperity is ſo far all in all, both to the proſperity of every Man's outward condition in general, and of the health, and wellfare of the Body in particular; that it is abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that either the one, or the other ſhould truly, and really proſper, but in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Soul-proſperity. There are two branches in this reaſon, and if both of them be made good, then the propoſition is ſo far made good: <hi>That of all proſperity, Soul-proſperity, is the moſt deſirable proſperity.</hi> And it is eaſie, to make them both good by Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That there is no true and real proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity to any Man's outward condition, without Soul-proſperity. This is true; yet it muſt be granted that very many whoſe Souls are poor, and blind, and naked, that lye dead, yea rotting in the luſts of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, do divide the good things of this
<pb facs="tcp:99371:55"/>World among them. Their portion is made fat, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.12. Inſomuch that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was aſtoniſhed at it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1,— <hi>Wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper? Wherefore are all they happy, that deal very treacherouſly?</hi> But this is far from true proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; for all this while, as their Perſons, ſo their Proſperity is under the curſe of God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2, <hi>I will even ſend a curſe upon you, and I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi> That which was threat'ned of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.17. lyes ſore, and heavy, upon ſuch to this day; though they neither ſee it, nor fear it, nor feel it: <hi>Curſed is their Basket, and curſed is their Store.</hi> This will be demonſtrated more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under another head, after I have made this good, That outward proſperity truly ſo called, and as it is a bleſſing, depends wholly upon Soul-proſperity. And that it doth ſo, is evident by this, That as all thoſe, ſo only thoſe whoſe Souls do proſper, are within the compaſs of the Promiſe of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their outward condition. The two firſt verſes of the firſt Pſalm give a fair character of a proſpering Soul, and the third verſe gives the Promiſe, That whatſoever ſuch a Soul doth (according to the rule of the Law, wherein it delighteth) ſhall proſper, ſo far as is conſiſtent with Soul-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Beyond that the Promiſe cannot reach it, neither doth any truly proſperous Soul deſire it.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:99371:55"/>
            <p>Here note two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That this was moſt eminently made good in the Old Teſtament: Where under that dark Diſpenſation of Spiritual Truths, and Bleſſings, the promiſes ran moſt upon externals. The only-wiſe God, ſaw it beſt of all ſo to encourage his then Infant Church as I may call it) to their duty. We read in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. that after God had engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon ſerious minding their Soul proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in this, and that, and other particulars. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. he engageth for all whatever in that kind, could be deſired; aſſuring them, that he would command a bleſſing upon them, in all their Store-houſes, and in all that they ſhould put their hand unto; and accordingly, this was made good. Whilſt <hi>Solomon</hi> kept the charge of the Lord, all things went well with him. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.11. It is ſaid, whatever he took in hand, he proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly effected. Thus God always dealt with that Nation, while Religion flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; and Soul-work proſpered, then all things proſpered. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.19. God calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them there, to obſerve, that their outward proſperity ſhould bear date, from that day forward, that they began to mind the good of their Souls. In the Second of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> God challengeth them to produce one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, at any time, to the contrary; but it was more, then they could do. There in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99371:56"/>
               <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. of that Chapter, thus the Lord ſpeaks unto them: <hi>O generation!—have I been a barren wilderneſs unto you?</hi> O gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration! Of what? Nay, that is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but a void ſpace is left, that any thing might be written of them, that was naught. O generation of Vipers, of Monſters, that might have proſpered, and would not. Well then, thus far it is clear, that Soul-proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, had the promiſes of outward proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and under that Diſpenſation, eminently made good.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As it was eminently ſo, then, it is really ſo, now; even at this day. All they whoſe Souls do proſper, as they are Heirs of all thoſe ancient promiſes, ſo they have promiſes ſuperadded of a later date, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.—<hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> Matth. 6.32, 33, <hi>Your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things. But ſeek ye firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> And ſometimes as, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.10,—<hi>the upright ſhall have good things in poſſeſſion.</hi> A full ſhare of outward bleſſings is given unto them, ſuitable to perſons of their condition, beyond what, once, they could have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or, it may be, did deſire; ſo that they have juſt cauſe thankfully to acknowledge,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99371:56"/>as <hi>David</hi> did, that their Cup runs over.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) When the only wiſe God, ſees it good, either to preſerve their Souls in, or to bring them into a more proſperous frame, then they are; to exerciſe them with ſome ſtraights, and to keep them ſhort, yet even then they may ſay that which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. (even then when their Cup is low) That the loving kindneſs of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them, ſo far, that what they have not, they want not, having learned to want; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied with that which they have of their own, within, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14,—<hi>A good Man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf:</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing the workings of the heart of God toward them, in his Fatherly care for them, remembring them in their low eſtate: and the workings of their own hearts toward God, in that, through grace, they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to reckon upon it, That God's allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is beſt for them; and that by faith, they can live upon him for their livelihood, when they have little in ſight, to live upon. So that they can ſubſcribe to what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. (as a true ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation) <hi>That godlineſs, with contentment, is great gain.</hi> They have the clear gain of a quiet, and well-compoſed ſpirit; ſo that their Souls dwell at eaſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.13. And is not this real proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Verily it is ſo. Are not theſe proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99371:57"/>perſons? Surely they are ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus, we ſee, the firſt branch of the firſt reaſon is confirmed: That the proſperity of Mens outward condition, in the general, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Soul-proſperity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other branch will be as clearly made good, That the health, and well-fare of the Body, ſtands upon the ſame bottom. No Man therein, ever did or ever ſhall tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and really proſper, but in conjunction with Soul-proſperity. This may ſeem at the firſt mentioning, as great a Paradox, as the former. But it is a juſt, and meaſured truth, and cannot but be acknowledged to be ſo, if we conſider the ſtate of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, either in reference to this World, or the World to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In reference to this World. Though it be true, that many whoſe Souls are death-ſtruck, ſinfully ſick unto death, the ſecond death, eternal death; in reſpect of their bodily health, live to a great old age, in great health, ſcarce knowing, for a long while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, what a days ſickneſs means: As <hi>Job</hi> obſerved in his time, <hi>Job</hi> 21.23. <hi>One dyeth in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe, and quiet;</hi> yet Bodily health as a bleſſing is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taninly annexed to Soul-proſperity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.7. 8,—<hi>fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</hi> The Soul proſpers that doth ſo, and while it doth ſo. And what then? <hi>It ſhall be health
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99371:57"/>to thy Navel, and marrow to thy Bones.</hi> Now, according to the ſtore of marrow, which moiſtens, and feeds the Bones; ſo is the ſtrength of the Body. And then, it ſhall be health to thy Navel. This is expreſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as Phyſicians ſay) Bodily health, in a natural way, depends chiefly on the vital parts, and entrails; which are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the Navel, becauſe there, they are knitt up, and faſtened. The meaning then is this: Fear the Lord, and depart from evil, and thy Body ſhall be ſtrong, and healthy. This ſhall be health to all thy fleſh, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.22, <hi>For they are life unto thoſe that find them, and health to all their fleſh.</hi> Thus it is, and will be, till ſickneſs and weakneſs be better for the well fare of the Soul; as it was to <hi>Gaius,</hi> in the Text, whoſe Soul proſpered the better, under his Bodily weakneſs. And when ſickneſs and weakneſs grow upon us, the gracious workings of a healthy, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Soul, are, in ſome ſenſe, the beſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and the moſt cheriſhing Cordials, to a weak, and languiſhing Body. When the Soul can ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. <hi>My heart, and my fleſh faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi> Iſa. 38.2, 3, Hezekiah <hi>turned his face to the wall, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord, and ſaid: Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked in truth before thee, and with a perfect heart,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99371:58"/>and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> It is obſervable what ye may read in the Book of Martyrs, concerning Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> that whilſt he was in examination, before the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> he felt a moſt raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſweetneſs from every part of his Body, come together to the place, and ſeat of his heart; and from thence, it did ebb and flow, to and fro, to every part of his body, to his marvellous conſolation. This he told to one of his friends.</p>
            <p>Thus far this branch of the reaſon is made good, That the health and wellfare of the Body, as it is a bleſſing, may be expected; and cannot otherwiſe be expected, then in conjunction with Soul-proſperity. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men think of it, this is true: That though Nature be an enemy to Grace, yet Grace, eſpecially thriving, and proſpering, is a friend, the beſt friend to Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In reference to the World to come, the well-being of the Body, to all Eternity, depends abſolutely upon the well-being of the Soul. That fares, as the Soul fares. If the Soul periſh, and be undone, the Body is undone, and periſheth too. We read <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24, 25. that when the Soul of the rich Man was in Hell, not the leaſt refreſhment could be had for his Body, not a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool his Tongue. Therefore as <hi>Job</hi> 27.8, <hi>He hath no hope of all that he hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99371:58"/>when God taketh away his Soul.</hi> But if the Soul proſpers, while it is in the Body (as it doth when it doth lay up its treaſure in Heaven, and hath its converſation in Heaven) then the Body when it is laid in the Grave, as it is ſtill a Member of Chriſt, death doth not diſſolve that union, <hi>It ſleeps in Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. And by virtue of that union, it ſhall be raiſed up, and made like the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus ye have the firſt reaſon made good, in both the branches of it, that Soul-proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ſo far all in all, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of all proſperities, Soul-proſperity is the moſt deſirable proſperity, becauſe it is made up of the moſt deſirable materials. Thoſe goods whereof it conſiſteth are the beſt things, the moſt deſirable bleſſings. It's true, the materials whereof Worldly proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity conſiſts are good things too. We read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. that the rich Man's purple Garments, and fine Linnen, which were his every-days-wearing, and his ſumptuous fare wherewith his Table was furniſhed every day, and his great eſtate which maintained all this, were good things in themſelves (and might have been good to him, if he had uſed them well.) So they are ſaid to be, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. But what are theſe things to the principles of Spiritual life, thriving and increaſing in the Soul? Verily, great heaps of Gold, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99371:59"/>Silver, are but great heaps of Duſt, and Dirt, to the leaſt grain of grace: <hi>The price of it is far above rubies,</hi> Job 28.18. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of one particular grace, the grace of Faith (one of theſe choiſe materials which make up ſoul proſperity) ſaith, That the Trial of it (when it is exerciſed) is much more pretious then Gold. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. No marvel then, if <hi>Solomon</hi> (who knew the worth of every thing, as much as ever any Man did) ſaith of it, <hi>That the Merchandize thereof is better then Silver, and the gain thereof then fine Gold.</hi> But of the excellency of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of Soul-proſperity, I need ſay no more then what hath been ſaid in the explication of the point; only I ſhall ſhew you a little, of that exceeding much, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of the materials of Worldly proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, by way of undervaluing them, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the eſteem of them, and, if poſſible, to beat down their price.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.1. ye find <hi>Solomon</hi> the King, to be <hi>Solomon</hi> the Preacher; and as he had a large heart, ſo he took a large Text to Preach upon; no leſs then the whole World, with all its honours, profits, and pleaſures, which raiſe up. Worldly proſperity to the higheſt Pinacle, that is imaginable: And (which is exceeding obſervable) after he had throughly ſtudied his Text, and taken as exact a ſurvey of it, as unwearied diligence
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99371:59"/>in ſearching, joyned with incomparable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, could attain unto, he could, with all his skill, raiſe but this one Doctrine, <hi>That all is vanity, vanity of vanities;</hi> extreme va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity all over. This was all he could make of all the fine things, that the World, in its beſt dreſs, (ſo far as he could ſee) did afford. And as he ſaith by way of queſtion, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.12, <hi>What can that Man do, that cometh after the King?</hi> after ſuch a King? If any Man will try whether he may have better ſucceſs, then <hi>Solomon</hi> had, I ſhall tell him what he ſhall find. This he ſhall find, and let him make his beſt of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That whatever reality he thinks that he finds, he will, after a while, find to be ſlight, and ſuperficial: That they only pleaſe the carnal, and ſenſual part. This was all their predeceſſor found, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19, <hi>I will ſay to my Soul, Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> Neither will they do this always, but a little diſappointment (the pride and paſſion of his own heart mingling with it) doth for the time, while the fit laſteth, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter all, as <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.13, <hi>Yet all this availeth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee</hi> Mordechai <hi>the Jew ſitting in the King's gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That even in this, whatever he finds, affords no laſting ſatisfaction, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8, <hi>All things are full of labour, Man cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99371:60"/>it. The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing.</hi> The eye may be ſatisfied, and wearied with the Act of ſeeing, but the luſt of the eye is not ſatisfied. The eye ſees this, and that, more then once, he thought he ſhould ever have ſeen, which he could have called his own: but yet ſtill the eye would ſee more. And it cannot be otherwiſe; for all that can be ſeen, is too little for a Man's heart. They may be a belly full, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. but they cannot be a heart full. There is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between the heart, and them; and therefore there can be no ſatisfaction. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, They cannot ſatisfie, becauſe they are always found to be leſs in the Enjoyment, then in the expectation: <hi>Gehazi</hi> found them ſo, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.26. He thought of purchaſing a great Farm, and of ſtocking it himſelf; but he found an evil diſeaſe cleaving to himſelf, and to his poſterity; and that for more years, then his Farm ſhould be either in his or in their poſſeſſion. And yet farther he will find, that they cannot ſatisfie, becauſe as they increaſe; ſo the heart is more and more let out unto them. And impoſſible it is, for that deſire ever to be ſatisfied, which grows, by the increaſe of the thing deſired. And yet more, ſay an earthly, narrow Soul may ſay, he is ſatisfied, yet Men may chooſe whether they will believe him or no. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this he will find, that though what he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99371:60"/>hath, may raiſe his eſteem in the World, yet no real worth is added unto him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. It is well, if they do not make him worſe. The valuation of Gold is raiſed ſometimes from twenty, to twenty four, or twenty five ſhillings, yet the piece is the ſame ſtill. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.21. And in his eſtate, ſhall ſtand up a vile perſon. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20,— <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> What therefore, if the Man St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, comes in, with a Gold-ring; if that be his beſt, wherein is he to be eſteemed? Many things more might be ſaid to this purpoſe, but this is enough to ſhew, that in reſpect even of the choiceſt materials thereof, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſperity is no way deſirable, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Soul-proſperity. If that be all a Man hath to rejoice in, he rejoiceth in a thing of nought, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13. It may be ſaid of all ſuch, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6. They walk in a vain ſhew, and ſurely diſquiet themſelves in vain, heaping up riches (which are accounted, the chiefeſt materials of Worldly proſperity) when he knows not who ſhall gather them, a wiſe man, or a fool. For any Man then to prejudice his Soul-proſperity, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of theſe things, contracts that guilt charged upon them, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.8, <hi>They follow lying vanities, and forſake their own mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third reaſon is this. Of all proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Soul-proſperity is the moſt deſirable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99371:61"/>proſperity, becauſe the effects, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents thereof, are the beſt, and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable effects; far beyond the effects of Worldly proſperity, ſeparated from Soul-proſperity: For then they are both, ſad, &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It is ſeen to be ſo, in reſpect of the effects thereof, in this World, and it would be found to be ſo, for the future, in the World to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In this World: Thereby, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that is in the heart appears; half whereof would not have been lomanifeſt, if they had not proſpered ſo much in the World. It proves but fuel for their luſts; drawing out multiplied acts of ſin, which is charged upon them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.7, <hi>Do not they</hi> (rich Men) <hi>blaſpheme that worthy name by which ye are called?</hi> Riches beget pride, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.19. <hi>There was a certain rich Man, which was clothed in Purple, and fine Linnen, and fared ſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every day.</hi> Pride begets caſting off truſt in God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, <hi>Charge them that are rich in this World that they be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God.</hi> Carnal boaſting, with contempt of others, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23, — <hi>Let not the rich Man glory in his riches.</hi> Carnal confidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10,—<hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your heart upon them.</hi> Oppreſſion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.6, <hi>Do not rich Men oppreſs you?</hi> Theſe are ſome of thoſe evil fruits, which a proſperous ſtate produceth, when Mens luſts are not ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99371:61"/>and mortifyed by Soul-proſperity. Men being charged to take heed of them, that ſhews their proneneſs to them. So that if the Angels were called to give ſuch an account, as they were, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.10, 11. doubtleſs they would give this account, that they never obſerved more notorious neglect of what is of everlaſting concernment, never more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the things of the fleſh, never more prodigious Riot in ſome, never more fordid Earthlineſs in others; the Earth they tread upon getting ſo into their hearts, that they are more Earthy then the Earth it ſelf. Such an account of theſe, and ſuch like abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Angels would give, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw more of theſe impieties, then among thoſe that proſper in the World, whoſe Worldly proſperity is ſeparated from Soul-proſperity. This is their way, as is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.13. and this is their folly. Theſe are the effects of it, that are ſeen in this World. Not that all theſe ſad effects are ſeen in every one, but ſome in one, and ſome in another.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The effects will be found to be as ſad in the World to come. It is a ſad ſight to ſee Men undo themſelves with their own mercies, as Bees that are drowned in their own Honey: but ſo it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32,—<hi>The proſperity of Fools ſhall deſtroy them. i.e.</hi> with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99371:62"/>the Lord. It is evident from Scritpure, that but few ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14, <hi>Many are called but few are choſen.</hi> And it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that but few of thoſe few, will be found among the rich, and proſperous, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, <hi>For ye ſee your calling, Brethren, that not many wiſe Men after the fleſh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called.</hi> Yea, it is yet more evident, that the Spirit of God ſpeaks in the Scritpure, as if Salvation had been almoſt impropriated to the meaner ſort of people; and that thoſe who proſper in the World, had been almoſt excluded. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5,—<hi>hath not God choſen the poor of this World, rich in faith, and Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> The Church is called the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the poor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.19. Such as were of the lower rank, deſtitute of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages. But for the rich, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.24, 25, <hi>Wo unto you that are rich, for ye have received your conſolation. Wo unto you, that are full, for ye ſhall hunger. Wo unto you that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn, and weep.</hi> Jam. 5.1. <hi>Go to now, ye rich Men, weep and howl, for the miſeries that ſhall come upon you.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks not by way of advice and counſel, to prevent their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by godly ſorrow. The exerciſe of that grace it not expreſſed by howling: but he ſpeaks by way of threat'ning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99371:62"/>wrath, and vengeance. They had their good things in this life: their pleaſure upon Earth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7, <hi>By how much ſhe glorified her ſelf, and lived de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, ſo much torment, and ſorrow give her.</hi> Yet this is not to be underſtood, as if God would condemn the rich, becauſe they were rich, no more then he will ſave the poor for their poverty: But he will condemn the rich for their ſin, and ſave the poor for their faith, and piety, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid, to ſhew that Worldly proſperity ſeparated from Soul-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, is by no means, a proſperity to be deſired. It is but Eternal miſery at a little diſtance: Much leſs is it to be compared with Soul-proſperity. This ye may judge by thoſe effects of it, which are ſeen to be ſo, in this World; and will be found to be ſo in the World to come.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) But now if we conſider the Effects, and Conſequents of Soul-proſperity, we ſhall find, they are every way moſt deſirable, whether we conſider the effects thereof for the preſent, in this life; or for the future, in the life to come.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In this life. When the Soul proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the divine well-fare thereof is kept, in its heavenly temper, by divine influences from above; then there is ſuch a glory and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99371:63"/>beauty in it, as is much ſet by, in the ſight of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11, <hi>So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty.</hi> It is a lovely ſight to ſee any thing grow, ſo as to thrive, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; Corn on the ground, Cattel in the field, Fruit on the tree. Children in the houſe, growing up as Olive Plants about the Table. But the growth, and proſperity of the Soul is much more lovely. Indeed there is much ſpiritual beauty and lovelineſs in the very firſt principles of ſpiritual life, wherein, (as I have ſhewed you) the firſt Foundation of Soul-proſperity, as to our diſcerning it, is laid. Theſe are much of the ſame nature, and bear the ſame name with that perfect ſtate of happineſs, which is enjoy'd in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As that is called, Glory, ſo are theſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, <hi>But we all with open face, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> And if ſo; then where all theſe lovely principles thrive and proſper, the ſpirit of glory reſts upon ſuch a Soul, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. This is ſo; but that which I ſhall ſpecially inſtance in, as moſt comprehenſive of the bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Soul-proſperity in this life, is that ſweet peace within, and heavenly ſerenity of ſpirit, which a proſperous Soul, ſo long as it doth proſper, may, and (if it know its own happineſs) uſually doth enjoy.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:99371:63"/>
            <p n="1">1. Much ſweet peace, becauſe of that ſweet agreement which there is between a Man's Conſcience, and Himſelf. Conſcience we know, if enlightened, preſſeth to duty; which, if neglected in its ſeaſon, will wound and ſting. A proſperous Soul is more afraid of this, then to be threat'ned with a fiery Furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.13. That did not affright them at all; but a Man may ſay as <hi>Job</hi> 27.6, <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it go: My heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi> He was not afraid of thoſe rebukings, and upbraidings. Now, when grace is kept in exerciſe, as it is in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Soul, this keeps peace, and that when troubles, and tryals come upon us, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Man. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, <hi>Our rejoicing is in this, the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the World.</hi> This eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the proſperity of his Soul, and that was his rejoicing. That prayer of the Apoſtle for others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. was heard for himſelf. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Much ſweet peace; becauſe there is a ſweet agreement, between a Man's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and his condition. A proſperous Soul living, and deſiring to live in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, is where it would be; and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99371:64"/>is willing to be, what God will have him to be, in the darkeſt hours that befall him, <hi>Rejoicing in hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2. This ſubdues his affection to his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when his condition otherwiſe would not be according to his affection. Being clear in the point, of his intereſt in God, he can ſay, how barren ſoever his condition be of outward comforts, <hi>The Lord is my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I have a goodly heritage,</hi> Pſal. 16.5, 6. Making God his Heaven, and his Earth too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) A ſweet peace: becauſe a ſweet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between a Man's Hope and his Reaſon. When the foundation of Soul-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is firſt laid, being quick'ned with principles of ſpiritual life, it is born again to a lively hope of the heavenly inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. And when the Soul proſpers, according to the knowledge it hath of its own ſtate, it is able to give a reaſon of its hope, as the expreſſion is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. A reaſon grounded upon the free promiſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. If ye continue in well-doing: and nothing is well done, where grace is not exerciſed. But if it be ſo, ye look for glory and immortality, and eternal life. Then following after righteouſneſs, holineſs, &amp;c. Eternal life is as it were within reach; we may lay hold on it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> had reaſon on his ſide, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. A good
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99371:64"/>ſight well managed, a good courſe well fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, a good faith well preſerved. <hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> Not becauſe of this, but becauſe of the free promiſe of God; for though a Man's Soul proſper to his dying day, yet eternal life is the gift of God, <hi>Roman.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Much ſweet peace: Becauſe there will be a ſweet agreement between a Man's Reſolutions, and his Performances; both in reſpect of Doing, and Suffering the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In doing what God requires. The principles of ſpiritual life, the firſt day they are received, ſo incline the heart heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ſuch reſolutions are taken up, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1, <hi>I ſaid, I will take heed to my ways.</hi> Now, when grace is not exerciſed, and the Soul proſpers not, then there is no keeping up this reſolution, good purpoſes are broken off. That divine principle which ſhould keep the heart from back-ſliding, is kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and oppreſſed by the contrary working of corruption. Such a Soul deals with God, as that Son did with his Father, to whom, he promiſed, to go, but went not. But now, ſo far as the Soul proſpers, Performances will be anſwerable to Reſolutions. See <hi>Paul</hi>'s reſolution, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16, <hi>And herein, do I exerciſe my ſelf to have always a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99371:65"/>void of offence toward God, and toward Men.</hi> Heb. 13.18, <hi>Pray for us; for we truſt we have a good Conſcience, in all things wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live honeſtly.</hi> And ſee his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12, <hi>I know how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound.</hi> It muſt needs be ſo; for the more the Soul proſpereth, every work of Religion will be the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with more delight, with leſs weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; with more conſtancy, and leſs deſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sweet peace; becauſe of ſweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between a Man's reſolutions, and his performances in reſpect of ſuffering what God impoſeth, and inflicteth; whether up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man's own perſonal account, or upon the common account of Religion; when the firſt principles of Soul-proſperity are infuſed, the Soul is inclined to comply with Chriſts injunction, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me.</hi> And the more the Soul proſpereth, the more the Will is melted down, into the Will of God, to ſuffer what God will, and that in ſubmiſſion to his Will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9, <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> Or upon the common account of Religion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, —<hi>others were tortured, not accepting delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they might obtain a better reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Know then, that all unquiet work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99371:65"/>in our Spirits, and all ſinking diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, in ſuch a day, and hour of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, come not from our condition, how ſad ſoever it be, or in how great danger ſoever, we may apprehend our ſelves to be, of loſing all we have; as from our Corruption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Souls proſper no more. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, what we have to this purpoſe, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>are the poor in ſpirit,</hi> verſ. 3. The meek, the mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the pure in heart, and thoſe that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes. And then, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted, for righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> And why is this put in the laſt place, but to ſhew unto us, that now the Soul proſpers? There is poverty of ſpirit: there is purity of heart; there is meekneſs, and hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs. Now ſuffering in theſe, is ſuch as becomes a Chriſtian. This is enough to prove this, That the more the Soul proſpers, there will be the more peace, becauſe the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt a Man's Reſolution, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, both in reſpect of Active and Paſſive obedience. A proſpering Soul makes this his buſineſs, <hi>To magnifie Chriſt, whether it be by life, or by death,</hi> Phil. 1.20.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) There is much ſweet peace in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Soul, becauſe of that ſweet agreement which there is between God, and ſuch a Soul;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99371:66"/>which, if it be felt, paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. and therefore, all expreſſion. But poſſibly, this Peace may not be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſo as every proſpering Soul may hear it, and believe it, rather often doubting, that it is not concluded. But for certain it is, and in due time God will let them know it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8, <hi>I will hear, what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace to his Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to his Saints.</hi> And it is as certain, ſuch Souls are at peace with God, for then they follow hard after God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. deſiring nothing more then reconciliation with him; their eyes dropping down tears, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.16,—<hi>becauſe the Comforter, which ſhould relieve my Soul is far from me. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ſuch mourners, for they ſhall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> Matth. 5.4.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſome of the deſirable effects of Soul proſperity, in this life.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) For the effects, and conſequents of Soul-proſperity for the future, in reference to the World to come, thus in a word; it hath a moſt bleſſed influence into Eternity: Then Soul-proſperity is perfected in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23,—<hi>The Spirits of juſt Men made perfect.</hi> Epheſ. 5.27, <hi>Without ſpot, or wrinkle.</hi> And perfected in happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the full enjoyment of God. It ſees God ſo far, as ſeeing imports enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Then it may be ſaid without a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99371:66"/>to ſuch a Soul, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.1, <hi>Ariſe, and ſhine, thy light is come, the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>That of all proſperities, Soul-proſperity, is the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable proſperity.</hi> Then from hence, we may infer: That it is the moſt rational thing in the World, for all thoſe, that believe they have immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, in mortal Bodies, to mind the well-fare, and proſperity of their Souls, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things elſe in the World. This is certainly to act, according to the beſt, and higheſt principles of reaſon, that ever any Man did from the beginning of the World to this day.</p>
            <p>It may be ſuppoſed, by what ye have heard, that ye are now fully ſatisfied in the truth of the Doctrine, and believe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proſpereth in your hand, with proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity truly ſo called, and as it is a bleſſing, but when, and where the Soul proſpereth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none to be minded like that, none but in ſubordination to that. And ſeeing it is a principle planted by the God of Nature, in the heart of Man by Nature, to mind that above all things elſe, wherein he firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99371:67"/>believes his happineſs, above all things, doth conſiſt. And withal, ſeeing to Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and to be happy, though the words be two, are but one and the ſame thing: And that ye are perſwaded, a Man is only ſo far really happy, as his Soul proſpers: Theſe things being ſo, one would think, I might forbear to preſs any thing farther, and might ſay concerning this duty of minding Soul-proſperity, as the Apoſtle doth of Brotherly love, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9. ye need not that I ſhould write any more concerning it.</p>
            <p>But conſidering what a deep, inward, rooted reſpect for, and reaching after the things of the World, there appears to be in ſome, who yet profeſs, they are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the vanity thereof, and ſuch a ſtrong byaſs in others, turning them aſide into ways that are not good: So far it may be charged upon them, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. They hold the truth (they believe) in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; not ſuffering it to exerciſe its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority in their Conſciences: And feeing it is ſo difficult a thing, yea impoſſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Almighty power of the Spirit of God, to raiſe up a droſly, earthy ſpirit, ſunk into the world, to look after things that are not ſeen; to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, and to ſet their affections on things that are above; or to ſix a vain, light ſpirit, ſo as to reduce it, to a ſober and ſerious conſideration of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99371:68"/>things of Eternity; and yet both the one, and the other muſt be done by all thoſe, that reſolve to mind the proſperity of their Souls above all other proſperity. I ſhall to what hath been ſaid already, (before I come to ſhew the great work that is to be done for the welfare of Souls) firſt give you ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove the Inference, <hi>That if Soul-Proſperity, be the most deſirable Proſperity; Then is it the moſt rational thing in the world, to mind it above all things elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is a rational thing (ye muſt all grant it) for any man to part with any thing, except the Peace of his own Conſcience, and to do any thing that is poſſible to be done, except ſinning againſt God, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of natural life. It is a Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.26. <hi>that Life is pretious.</hi> It is indeed the moſt pretious thing in Nature. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. <hi>Is not the life more than meat? Act.</hi> 27. They caſt away the Lading of the Ship, in hope to ſave their lives, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4, <hi>Let my life be given me at my petition. For we are ſold, I and my people to be deſtroyed, to be ſlain, and to periſh. If we had beenſold for Bond-men, and for Bond-women, I had held my tongue.</hi> See how ſhe pleaded for her life; he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued not the one half of 127 Provinces, in compariſon of that. And we read of a poor woman, that had ſpent all that ſhe had, in hope of health, which is a degree below life,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99371:68"/>
               <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. Now if it ſhould be asked, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14. What is this life, that is ſo much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued? we muſt anſwer, as he doth, <hi>That it is a vapour which appeareth for a very little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> The frailty whereof is ſet forth by heaps of ſimilitudes in Scripture, from the moſt periſhing things that come under obſervation. It is but a little warm breath, turned in, and out at our noſtrils, a narrow paſſage, and ſoon ſtopt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Ceaſe from Man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and wherein is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it be ſo agreeable to reaſon, by all lawful means to ſerve the Providence of God, for the preſervation of ſuch poor, and frail things as our lives are; (as indeed we are bound in obedience to God's command) Is it not much more rational, to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God would have us to do, for the life and well-fare, of our immortal Souls? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if Nature teach a Man to prize his life above the World, Grace ſhould make a Man to prize his Soul above his Life. Believe it, To ſave our Lives, and to ſave our Souls, are two things. This we find in Scripture, that thoſe who have learned to value their Souls, according to their excellency, and have underſtood how much their own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is concerned in them, have willingly run the hazard of their lives, to ſave their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99371:69"/>Souls, not only as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27, <hi>I keep under my Body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away;</hi> but alſo as they, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.11,—<hi>they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> They did not ſo love their lives, as out of inordinate care to preſerve them, and ſo to eſcape death, when God called them, by their open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to give in their teſtimony for Chriſt, and his Goſpel, againſt the Anti-Chriſtian Generation. So <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.19, &amp;c. The three Witneſſes choſe rather to be thrown into the fiery Furnace, then to worſhip the Golden Image. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, <hi>Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance.</hi> Yea ſo careleſs have ſome of the Saints of old, been of their Bodies, in compariſon of their care for the well-fare of their Souls, as if they had been other folks Bodies, and not their own. We read <hi>Act,</hi> 7, that when the ſentence of death was paſſed upon <hi>Stephen,</hi> he prays not for the mitigation of his Enemies rage, he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſilent concerning his burial. (It's true, there were ſome good Men took care of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2. but not at his intreaty that we read of) but that which his thoughts were moſt taken up withal, ye read <hi>verſ.</hi> 59. <hi>They ſtoned</hi> Steven, <hi>calling upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> So the Lord Jeſus left his Body in the hands of <hi>Pilate,</hi> but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99371:69"/>he commended his Spirit into his Father's hands, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.46. It is obſervable, what we have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7, 8. when ſome of <hi>David</hi>'s followers, were hackt, and hewed in pieces, and left unburied, or (as ſome think) when their dead Bodies, after they were buried, were digged up, and their bones were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about the Grave's mouth: When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaw, or heard of this, ſee what he had moſt in his thoughts: <hi>Lord, leave not my Soul deſtitute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye have one argument to make good the Inference: That it is the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing in the World, to mind the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Souls, above all things elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very rational, above all outward things, to mind the preſervation of our lives. And that though it be ſo, thoſe that have been wiſe to Salvation, have minded the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Souls, above the ſaving of their Lives, there being indeed no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Natural life, and the Spiritual life of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is every way moſt rational, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the beſt, and higheſt principles of reaſon, to mind that moſt, which Jeſus Chriſt (in whom dwelt all the Treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) minded moſt. This none will deny, but that as it is the higheſt pitch of our holineſs, that our Ends in all things fall in with his: So it ought to be our greateſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99371:70"/>that in all things we ſhould be of the ſame mind with Chriſt. Now that this was, and ſtill is the greateſt work that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did, and ſtill doth mind in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, will appear by theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This was the great work, next to the glorifying of his Father (and therein he did glorifie his Father) that was in his heart to accompliſh; in, and by that myſterious work of his Incarnation, in taking upon him Man's nature, and for which he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no reputation in the World; for which he ſuffered ſo much, and ſtill doth ſo much by his interceſſion in Heaven, to this day, that (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.) he might ſee the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of his own Soul, and be ſatisfied in the complete, and Eternal proſperity, of all their Souls, which God the Father gave unto him, and for which he engaged himſelf. <hi>John</hi> 6.38, 39, 40, <hi>For I came down from Heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the Fathers will which ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again, at the laſt day.</hi> In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. Chriſt is ſaid to be the Shepherd of Souls. Now a faithful Shepherd, though he will be ready to do his Maſter, what good ſervice he can, in any thing; yet his chiefeſt care is for his Maſter's flock. Such a faithful Shepherd is Jeſus Chriſt, he highly minds the meaneſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99371:70"/>thing, wherein any of his are concerned: Satan (to his own great vexation) cannot overlook this, <hi>Job</hi> 1.10, <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath, on every ſide?</hi> And we know, that when he was viſibly in the World, he was exceeding helpful to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, yet his chiefeſt care was over his peculiar flock, as the Shepherd of Souls. He laid down his Natural life, to procure their Spiritual life: That dead Souls might live, and living Souls proſper. That they might have life, and live in abundance. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10, 11. For this end he ever lives to make interceſſion for thoſe that come unto him, that they might be ſaved to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. And as the effect of his interceſſion (according to his promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.16.) he ſends the Spirit of Grace into their hearts, to work in them all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that accompany Salvation. And to abide in them, to preſerve what he hath wrought, that in believing, their Souls might be ſaved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. And that they might receive the end of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt thing, that Jeſus Chriſt minded this moſt, in our behalf, that for this cauſe he came into the World, to ſeek, and to ſave loſt Souls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.10.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This is the great end, he aims to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99371:71"/>on by all his Ordinances. The Law of God (that is the whole Doctrine revealed in the word) is for the Converſion of Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. And for Edification of Souls, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.32. I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up. The Sacraments are Spiritual Food for Souls. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4, <hi>And did all eat the ſame Spiritual meat. And did all drink the ſame Spiritual drink.</hi> Yea, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (that dreadful Ordinance, ſo it be managed according to the mind of Chriſt) for it is a delivering a Man to Satan, yet it is with reſerence to the good of his Soul, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>To deliver ſuch a one unto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For this end, he appointed the Miniſtry to be a ſtanding Ordinance unto the end of the World, that they might watch over Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. This was that which the Apoſtles aimed at, according to their Commiſſion from Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he was made all things to all Men, that by all means, he might ſave ſome,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.22. In his removal from one place to another, he aimed at the conveying of ſome Spiritual gift, where ever he came, for the good of Souls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11, <hi>For I long to ſee you, that I may impart to you, ſome Spiritual gift.</hi> In all his prayers, for thoſe to whom he wiſhed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99371:71"/>all the good that might be, this was the great thing he deſired in their behalf, that their Souls might proſper, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16, 17, <hi>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might, by his Spirit, in the inner Man. That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 6.18, <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with your Spirit.</hi> Proſpering Souls were his joy, and Crown, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This was, and is the great end of all his Providential Diſpenſations. They are, or may be, all them, either Food, or Phyſick for the Soul. Thriving in holineſs, as ye have heard, is Soul-thriving. Now this is the end, that all comforting, deſirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences ſeem to drive on, <hi>Obad.</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>But upon Mount Zion, there ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and there ſhall be holineſs.</hi> All afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaddening Providences, are for the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10, <hi>God chaſteneth us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> Yea for this very cauſe, it often goes very ill with many of thoſe that live highly in the love of God, in their outward condition, that their ſpiritual condition may proſper, and flouriſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9, <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin:</hi> Which is the ſickneſs, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be the death of the Soul, and its
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99371:72"/>deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71, <hi>It is good for me, that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> And therefore he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to the praiſe of the wiſdom, and rich grace of God, that in very faithfulneſs to the intereſt of his Soul, the hand of the Lord had been upon him, ſo as it was.</p>
            <p>Now lay all this together: That this was the great end of Chriſt's Incarnation, Death, and Suffering, and Interceſſion: The great end for which all Ordinances, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are appointed to be ſubſervient unto, and it will evidently appear, that this was, and is, above all things elſe, moſt upon the heart of Chriſt, in our behalf, that our Souls might proſper; therefore it ought to be moſt upon our hearts, and it is moſt rational, it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is every way moſt agreeable to the beſt, and higheſt principles of reaſon, with all poſſible diligence, and ſeriouſneſs to mind that, the neglect whereof, will be our utter undoing, to all Eternity, and bring both Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Soul under the moſt abſolute, and unavoidable wo, and miſery, that ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell, or poſſibly can befall any Creature, that ever God made, next unto the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. That principle of ſelf-preſervation planted in the heart of Man by Nature, if improved, cannot but teach him this; That it is moſt rational for him to mind that, the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99371:72"/>neglect whereof would bring this ruine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Now what wo, and miſery is laid up for a neglected, periſhing, unproſpering Soul, ye have fully expreſſed, beyond what can be conceived, in one verſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. whereof I ſhall mention but theſe two particulars, which are of all others, moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and terrible.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Such a Soul is deſigned to be driven away from God; with his curſe upon them, Never to ſee his face, To be Eternally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thoſe everlaſting joys, which Souls that live and proſper, in a moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fullneſs do enjoy, in the enjoyment of God, whilſt the everlaſting God enjoys his own bleſſed ſelf. If this were all, the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were unſpeakable: It is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.37, 38. that when <hi>Paul</hi> took his leave of his friends at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> it was a very ſad part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; <hi>They all wept very ſore, fell upon</hi> Paul<hi>'s neck, and kiſſed him, ſorrowing moſt of all, for the words, which he ſpake unto them, that they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi> If this were ſuch an heart-breaking unto them, it muſt needs be impoſſible for any, that ever taſted, in any meaſure, how gracious the Lord is, to bear ſo much as a thought of never ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of never enjoying God more. Ye know, for a Man to loſe his ſight were very ſad, though he ſhould have no pain in his eyes, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.11. Truly light is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99371:73"/>ſweet, and it is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun: So that a Man would ſcarce think, that the greateſt Worldly proſperity were enough to repair that loſs. What then would this blind perſon think of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if beſides the loſs of his ſight, one ſhould ſtand by, and continually be dropping ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lead into his eyes? Yet ſo it is here. For,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) A loſt, unproſperous Soul is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned to be thus driven away from God, but it is deſigned to the ſame miſery, and the ſame torment with the Devils; and this they can neither eſcape, nor endure. None can anſwer that queſtion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14, <hi>Can thine heart endure, or thine hands be ſtrong, in the day when I ſhall deal with thee?</hi> No, it cannot. <hi>For who knoweth the power of thine anger: even according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath,</hi> Pſal. 90.11. None is able to expreſs, yea nor to conceive, what a dreadful thing it is, to be buried, as it were, alive, under the Tomb-ſtone of the infinite wrath of the ever-living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> Rev. 6.15, 16, 17,—<hi>They ſhall hide themſelves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains. And ſay to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99371:73"/>day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> This is that which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can poſſibly enter into the heart of Man to conceive. Ye find up and down in the Scripture, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is moſt terrible to ſenſe, is made uſe of, to expreſs the terribleneſs of it, and yet comes far ſhort of it. Let but this one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſink into your hearts, and be, if but once a week, ſeriouſly thought on, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, this alone may convince you of the truth of what I ſay. That it is the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing in the World, for all thoſe who believe they have immortal Souls, in mortal Bodys, to mind the well-fare, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Souls, above all things elſe in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let me add one argument more. It is the moſt rational thing in the World, for every Man ſeriouſly to mind that, which above all things elſe, beſt anſwers God's great end in giving him his Being, and with it, all that is needful for ſupport, together with more underſtanding then the Beaſts of the field: And if ye ask, what this is? ye have an anſwer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4, <hi>God made all things for himſelf:</hi> For the glorifying of his own bleſſed name. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11, <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: To whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> Now as no Man diſhonours God, but in doing that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99371:74"/>which tends to the ruine and deſtruction of his own Soul. So no Man doth any thing, or poſſibly can do any thing, which really tends to the will-fare of his own Soul, but therein he alſo glorifies God. For inſtance, To live in the exerciſe of Repentance; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, and humbling our Souls in the ſight of God, for our daily failings. To live in the exerciſe of Faith, applying our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, as interceding, in our behalf for grace, and mercy, ſuitable to our daily ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, reſting upon his truth, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his promiſes, notwithſtanding all difficulties appearing in the way of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment: Walking in the fear of the Lord, and fruitfulneſs in every good work: Theſe are all great fartherers of Soul-proſperity, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.19, <hi>My Son, give glory to God, and make confeſſion to him.</hi> Revel. 16.9,—<hi>They repented not, to give glory to God.</hi> Rom. 4.19, 20,—<hi>but was ſtrong in faith, giving glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God.</hi> Iſa. 8.13, <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> Joh. 15.8, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.</hi> This is as certain, as that Jeſus Chriſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Father, in finiſhing the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and Salvation, for loſt ſinners. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4.</p>
            <p>Thus ye have the Inference made good.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> If this be ſo, That Soul proſperity
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99371:74"/>is the moſt deſirable proſperity; and that it is therefore (as ye have heard) the moſt rational thing in the World, to mind it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things elſe. Then be perſwaded (as the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> adviſeth, <hi>ch.</hi> 46.8.) <hi>To remember this, bring it again to mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon it, and ſhew your ſelves to be Men;</hi> that act according to principles of reaſon, and not Brutes. Let that ſink into your hearts, which ye may read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. The Lord there aggravates their unworthy deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him by this, That though he knew their averſneſs to what he had required of them, yet he had not drawn them to their duty, by violence, as unruly Bullocks to the yoak, but in a way ſingularly obliging, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to rational Creatures, He had drawn them with the Cords of a Man, with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his bounty, and goodneſs, which of all others, carry the higheſt grounds of reaſon with them, why God ſhould be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This, I ſay, ſhould be ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that reflecting on our ſelves, and finding that God deals thus with us, draws us with the Cords of a Man, in an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative way to perſwaded us to this great duty: O then let us be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtir up our ſelves with the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bent of our endeavours, from this day forward, to mind it as the great buſineſs of our lives, and pray (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27.) that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99371:75"/>God would enlarge our hearts, and fill them with deſires, and reſolutions about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and diligently hearken to the counſel, which God, in his word, preſcribes you in this great affair.</p>
            <p>To make way to acquaint you with what that is, I muſt mind you a little of that which was more largely ſpoken unto, when we firſt entred upon the explication of the point. Two things were then endeavoured to be cleared unto you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherein the proſperity of the Soul conſiſteth, and when it may be ſaid to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I told you then, that the proſperity thereof is to be conſidered both in its firſt riſe, and foundation: Or in its growth, and progreſs. As to the firſt riſe of it, it was proved, that if we look upwards, we ſhall find it begin in God's Eternal, Electing love, which is without beginning. But if we look inwardly, ſo as to diſcern it in our ſelves. The firſt foundation of it is laid in that day, and hour (though the very day and hour hath, I think, not been diſcerned by many, though perhaps by ſome.) But however diſcerned, or not diſcerned, in that day and hour, it begins, when by the word of Chriſt, and by the Spirit of Chriſt, the whole Man, both Soul and Body is brought into a ſtate of Union with Chriſt. For then the Soul receives the firſt Seeds of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99371:75"/>principles of Spiritual life, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be in a capacity of proſpering.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the firſt foundation is laid in theſe principles: So the growth and progreſs thereof conſiſts in their increaſe. As they increaſe, ſo the proſperity of the Soul increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. So that if ye give up your ſelves to be guided by right reaſon, your work for the ſubſtance of it, is firſt to ſee that your Souls are Spiritually alive. And ſecondly, that they thrive and proſper in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live.</p>
            <p>In reference to the former of them, I have two things to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To all, and every one of you, that you would ſet ſome time apart, ſeriouſly to debate the matter, between God, and your ſelves alone, and none elſe with you: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever ye felt the day of God's power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſpirits, to prevail ſo far upon you. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To caſt you down from the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which ye had of your ſelves, by a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough conviction of the woful miſtake wherein ye were, about the ſtate of your Souls. That ye thought them alive, when they were (as now ye ſee) dead in ſin, pleaſing your ſelves with the Religion of your Education, as <hi>Paul</hi> did before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſon. That ye thought, ye had good hearts toward God, whereas now ye ſee, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99371:76"/>(as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.9.) your inward parts were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wickedneſs. That whereas ye thought not of any danger ye were in of the wrath to come, now ye ſee, ye are condemned by a holy, and righteous Law. And that, what by reaſon of your Actual ſins, and what by reaſon of your Original ſin, ye utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Salvation in that ſtate wherein ye pleaſed your ſelves, and ſee clearly that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reformation will not ſerve your turn, but ye muſt be inwardly changed into the Image of God, and be born again by the Spirit of God, elſe ye can never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This is ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting down, as <hi>Paul</hi> experienced when he ſaid, <hi>Sin revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether, beſides this caſting down, ye have alſo experienced the day of God's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo far to prevail upon you, as to raiſe up your hearts, to a willing, and hearty accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Chriſt, to all intents and purpoſes, in order to Salvation. To kill, and deſtroy that enmity which you find in your hearts, againſt the ways of God, ſo as to bring you into a ſtate of Reconciliation with God, and to all the means of conformity to him, and Communion with him, to impute unto you the merits of Chriſt's death, for a full and free diſcharge from the guilt of all your ſins, and to impute unto you his Righteouſneſs, that ye may be accepted as righteous, unto
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99371:76"/>Eternal life. To mortifie all your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to quicken your dead hearts, with the principles of Spiritual life; thoſe principles of true holineſs, without which, ye know, ye ſhall never ſee God; with a ſincere reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in his ſtrength to wait upon him, and keep his way. That he would do all this for you, and work all this in you; and that ye are humbled for defects in living no more upon him, that he might be all this unto you. Verily, ſo far as any perſon can really aſſert this, that thus he hath been caſt down, and thus he hath been, and is raiſed up; though he may ſometimes be in the dark, as to the ſafety of his eſtate for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; he hath good Scripture ground (thò he may not ſee it) to believe that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into fellowſhip with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. And that his Soul begins to live, and is in a capacity of proſpering: For when the Soul (it may be, after a long ſhutting up under unbelief) thus opens to Chriſt, then Chriſt comes into the Soul, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. And when he comes, he brings the principles of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life with him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt Particular. A word to all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have a word to ſome, to thoſe I mean, that know nothing, as yet, what either this caſting down, or lifting up, means. And it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99371:77"/>is a word of advice, That as ever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their Souls ſhould live, and be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of proſpering, that they would break off, from all their dead works, and reſolve, for this end, that they may be thus caſt down, and lifted up, <hi>To be ſwift to hear,</hi> as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.19. And to attend unto the words of this life, ſo as it is ſaid to be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. The word, whereby dead Souls are quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25,—<hi>the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> And that in order hereunto, ye would take the right way of working what ye hear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts; thus, or to this purpoſe, reaſon the caſe with your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Soul-proſperity, I am now convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is the moſt deſirable proſperity: And if my Soul proſper not, all the ſooner, poſſibly, it may never proſper, for, this night, it may be taken from me. And if it do not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nothing will proſper with me, ſo as to turn to good, whilſt I live: and when I am dead, I ſhall be one of the moſt woful, and miſerable Creatures, to all Eternity, that ever God made, next to the Devils.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If my Soul be, as I have reaſon to be aſraid it is, ſtill in its unregenerate ſtate, then it is ſpiritually dead in ſin; and while it continues ſo, it is in no more capacity of proſpering, then a dead Tree, while it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues dead, is in a capacity of bringing forth
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99371:77"/>ripe fruit. This I now clearly ſee, though I did not ſo much as think on it before.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If I do not ſo receive Jeſus Chriſt, as that Jeſus Chriſt may receive me, into a ſtate of Union with himſelf, my Soul can never live, for ſo I hear from, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) If I would ſo receive Jeſus Chriſt, as that he may receive me, into Union with himſelf, and I receive life from him, I muſt ſo receive the word, as to be ſo caſt down, and ſo lifted up, as I have heard. Therefore, by his help, I reſolve for this end to hear, yea as I am commanded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. diligently to hear, to hearken, and to incline mine Ear: And to make application to my ſelf, of what may be for my caſting down, and for my lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up; that, according to the promiſe, in that Text, my Soul may live.</p>
            <closer>This do, and Live.</closer>

And, becauſe every thing almoſt, that I have to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in handling this great, and neceſſary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, needs much enforcement, becauſe much neglected, I ſhall, before I come to the Directions, ſpeak ſomething, by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99371:78"/>to heighten your endeavours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Conſider then.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A Soul, that is alive to God, though burdened with a weak, Conſumptive Body, and with a conſiderable fullneſs of outward bleſſings (both which, many times, are great diſadvantages) yet may proſper. We ſee it exemplified in <hi>Gaius;</hi> He was but of a weak, and craſie Conſtitution, that's implyed in the Text. And he was withal, a Man of ſome Eſtate, in the World: That's implyed <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Which have born witneſs of thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, before the Church.</hi> Yet neither the one, nor the other hindered, but that his Soul did proſper. It was as <hi>John</hi> ſaid; for doubtleſs <hi>John</hi> was as far from giving flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing titles, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaid, he was, <hi>Job</hi> 32.22.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Our Souls ought to be as dear unto us, as the Soul of <hi>Gaius</hi> was to him. If <hi>Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> made Religion his buſineſs, minding, above all things, that one thing which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. If he kept his heart above all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, So that neither Corruption from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor Temptation from without, could ſet his Salvation-work backward. If he laid up his treaſure in Heaven, valuing both the beſt things, and the worſt things of the World, as ſomething, or as nothing unto him, farther then as they might be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to promote the Eternal well-fare of his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99371:79"/>Soul. All which, without doubt, in a great meaſure he did, and more then all this too; otherwiſe, he had never received this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from ſuch a Man, as <hi>John</hi> was; which, to his honour, hath ſtood upon Record, theſe 1600 years, and ſhall do to the end of the World. For as our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> Matth. 26.13. So wherever this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſhall be read in the whole World, this that <hi>Gaius</hi> did, ſhall be told, for a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of him, That his Soul did proſper. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. We ought to <hi>go, and do likewiſe.</hi> For he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no more obligation to do what he did, then we are: And our Souls ought to be as dear to us, as his was to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is not one word to be found to the contrary in all the Scripture, but that how ſhort ſoever, we come of this pattern, at preſent, yet if we ſet our ſelves to do, as he did, our Souls may proſper as much, as ever his did. Jeſus Chriſt, we are ſure, can make them proſper, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10,—<hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.8. <hi>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he were rich, yet for our ſakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that we by his poverty might be made rich.</hi> Eph. 3.20,—<hi>He is able to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundantly, above all that we ask, or think, according to the power, that worketh in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99371:79"/>us.</hi> Neither, (which is much to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) doth he ſpeak of his abſolute power; by which he is able to do more, then he will do, but of his Ordinary working pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for ſo it is, in the latter end of the verſe. <hi>[According to his power that worketh in us.]</hi> So that we may conclude, that he hath not out-acted the greatneſs of his power, in, or for the proſpering of any Man's Soul; but he can work as much again, for another. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, <hi>He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up, far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.</hi> As he filled up the whole work of his Mediatorſhip, which was to be done upon Earth: So he aſcended up to Heaven, to fulfil what remains, and that is, for ever to fill even all the living members, of his myſtical Body with the Principles of Spiritual life, ſo that every one ſhall receive according to his meaſure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7, <hi>But unto every of us is given grace, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he tell any Man, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ſo much, that he will give him no more. No Man knows, how great his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may be; The grace that Chriſt intends to give, he gives not all at once; ſo that a Man may hope, his works may be beſt at laſt; as was ſaid of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There is no particular grace, though it be in the Soul, at preſent, but as ſmoaking
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99371:80"/>Flax, but it may by daily exerciſe, and good uſage, grow to a great eminency.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is no Corruption, though more deeply Rooted then others, in a Man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution, but that, in time, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Spirit, bringing it to the Law of Chriſt, to the death of Chriſt, and to the love of Chriſt, and joining his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the Spirit of Chriſt, he may get an eminent victory over it, and ſee it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, fall down before him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) There is no particular duty, how backward, and indiſpoſed ſoever he may be to it, at preſent, or hath been, a long time heretofore againſt it, but he may grow to an eminency in the practice of it.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) There is no one temptation, of what kind ſoever, or how often ſoever he hath been overcome by it, but by taking to himſelf the whole armour of God; and ſtrengthening himſelf in the ſtrength of the Lord (which is every ones duty to do) but he may ſo reſiſt it, and conquer it, that the Devil ſhall fly before him.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) There is no condition, how many ſnares ſoever, it may be compaſſed about withal, but through the exerciſe of grace, it may be managed to ſuch Spiritual advantage as may exceedingly promote Soul-proſperity.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) There are no doubts, no fears, no ſinking diſcouragements, ariſing from what
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99371:80"/>ſpring ſoever, but they may be anſwered, and ſcattered as a miſt before the Sun, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth in its full ſtrength.</p>
            <p>By all this we ſee that it is as I have ſaid: That as there is no reaſon for any Man abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to conclude, though he apprehend himſelf, at preſent to be Spiritually dead, that his Soul ſhall never live: So there is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for any Man to doubt, who is really, though weakly alive to God, but that waiting upon God, and keeping his way, his Spiritual life may grow to be live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his Soul may proſper as much as ever the Soul of <hi>Gaius</hi> did. Therefore, let us up, and be doing, and the Lord will be with us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13, <hi>Work out your own Salvation, with fear, and trembling. For it is God, that worketh in you, both to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> This is that which ſlackens many Mens endeavours, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think they ſhall never attain to ſuch an height of Soul-proſperity, as others have attained unto; therefore they ſtir not up themſelves, to reach after any proſperity at all; as is charged on them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7, <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> As ſome poor Men, becauſe they think, they ſhall never get beforehand, as many of their Neighbours do; whatever others get, they ſhall never be worth a Groat, and therefore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99371:81"/>mind no more then to live from hand to mouth. But we have not ſo learned Chriſt. This is all that I ſhall ſay by way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to perſwade.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to ſpeak of the former of thoſe two Particulars, mentioned but now: That thoſe that are ſpiritually alive, ought to ſee to it, that their Spiritual life be live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and proſper, becauſe therein the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Souls conſiſteth. The great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be enquired into, is to ſhew what is to be done, in order to the carrying on, of this holy, and bleſſed deſign. In ſpeaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, Let this be conſidered. That there is a Rule for, and a Regiment of Health for the Soul, as there is for the Body. And what in a natural way, may be preſcribed, and ought to be made uſe of, for the wel-fare of the one, may be preſcribed, and ought to be made uſe of, in a Spiritual way, for the well-fare of the other. Of this kind, there are five ſeveral things, which I ſhall ſpeak to in order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reference to Bodily health, upon good adviſement, the ſeaſonable uſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is neceſſary. This is an Ordinance of God, and ought to be uſed in faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God. Sometimes, for preventing of Diſeaſes, which otherwiſe might prejudice our health, and ſometimes for curing, and removing of them, which otherwiſe may endanger our life. Anſwerably to this, we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99371:81"/>find in the Scripture (which is the Magazine, and Store-houſe for all Spiritual Receipts) Phyſick preſcribed for the Soul, by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the great Phyſician of Souls; without the due, and ſeaſonable uſe whereof, it is impoſſible, the Soul ſhould proſper.</p>
            <p>Before I tell you what it is, it is fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Soul of every Man, Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alive to God, is as ſubject to Spiritual Diſeaſes, as the Body of any living Man is to Bodily Diſeaſes. And it is ſin alone, and nothing elſe but ſin, which is the ſickneſs of the Soul, and which if it be not cured, will be the death, and deſtruction of the Soul. It is the reſemblance by which it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth in the Scripture; and that moſt fitly, as all Scripture reſemblances are. For as ſickneſs hinders the operation of Nature, waſting, and conſuming, by degrees, both the Natural heat, and Radical moiſture, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changing, and altering a Man's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as <hi>Job</hi> 2.12, <hi>And when they lift up their eyes afar of, and knew him not.</hi> Often cauſing much pain, ſo as the ſick Man grows worſe (and unleſs happily recovered, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, upon the uſe of Means) untill death ſeize upon him. So that ſickneſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, is truly ſaid, to be contrary to Nature, an Enemy to Nature. Even ſuch a thing is ſin to the Soul: It is contrary to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99371:82"/>the well-fare, and proſperity of it. It Wars againſt it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. It hinders the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious actings of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21, <hi>I find a Law then, that when I would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me.</hi> It puts even living, and good Souls under ſuch a diſguiſe, that they neither ſpeak, nor do like themſelves. As <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife, (though it is believed, that ſhe was a good Woman) yet ſhe ſpake (as her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band told her) as one of the fooliſh Women, <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. Their unmortified luſts put them under ſuch a diſguiſe, that they walked as Men; as thoſe that were ſtill dead in ſin, and never had received any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Spiritual life. And farther, As ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cauſeth pain; ſo guilt following of ſin, often cauſeth intolerable pain, in the anguiſh, and chargings of Conſcience. In a word, ſin being indulged conſumes, and waſtes what is of God, in the Soul; ſo (as it is ſaid of the worſt of Men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.) it grows worſe, and worſe; and if not happily preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it ends, at laſt, in Eternal death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As in all theſe reſpects, ſin is ſuch a thing to the Soul, as ſickneſs is to the Body: So, that we may be the more affected, and take the more notice of it, It is fitly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſame name. As Pride is fitly compared to a Tympany; Earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a Dropſie; Carnal ſecurity to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99371:82"/>Unruly paſſions to a Frenzy; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and Back ſliding from the ways of God, to the Falling-ſickneſs; Envy, to a Conſumption; An unquiet, diſcontented Spirit, to the grief of the Bowels: Sore Diſeaſes, all of theſe are. And beſides all theſe, Original ſin is as a Leproſie, over-ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the whole Soul. This evil Diſeaſe, which is, indeed, all Diſeaſes in one, cleaves unto all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, as <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie did to all his Seed; for his Son (if he had any) and his Son's Son, and ſo from generation to generation, were all Lepers, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though this be generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That ſin is the ſickneſs of the Soul; therefore the Soul proſpers only ſo far as it is well rid of it; yet this would be farther obſerved, That though ſin have ſuch evil effects upon the Soul, as Diſeaſes have upon the Body: and that the names of Bodily Diſeaſes, do ſo fitly reſemble the Diſeaſes of the Soul: yet the difference is great, as to that which is required, to diſpoſe the ſick in Soul, and the ſick in Body, toward a recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In the Diſeaſes of the Body it matters not much (it may perhaps ſomething, but much it doth not) whether the ſick Man know the name or nature of his Diſeaſe; ſo he have a faithful, and skillful Phyſician: Nor whether he know the virtue of what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99371:83"/>is preſcribed him, or the compoſition of it. Or whether he be able to judge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or declining of his Diſeaſe, by the beating of his Pulſe: Though perhaps, ſome inſight into theſe things, might afford to ſome perſons at leaſt, ſome ſatisfaction; yet they are left ſpecially to the care, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Phyſician, who often conceals the danger, leſt the ſick Man's fears, and phanſie might do him more hurt, then his Phyſick doth him good. But it is otherwiſe in Soul-ſickneſs; a clear inſight into the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, is of great uſe, that every one ſhould underſtand (according to that expreſſion, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.38.) the plague of his own heart; and what ſtrength it hath got over him; how long it hath been growing upon him, and by what means, and occaſions, he fell into it. Theſe are good ſteps toward ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual health. This is required in order to cure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Know, and acknowledge thine iniquity.</hi> And then, diſtinctly to underſtand the way of cure, and to follow thoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which Jeſus Chriſt the great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of our Souls, preſcribes, is a far greater, and better ſtep.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall now lay before you what is preſcribed by him.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When the Body is full of corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, there is need of Purging Phyſick.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99371:83"/>Even ſuch need hath the Soul, when it is over-grown, and oppreſſed, with corrupt luſts, which are the noiſome ſteams of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal corruption. It was well with them, of whom it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. that they had purified their Souls. This is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8, <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye double-minded.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1,—<hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the fleſh, and ſpirit.</hi> This is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary; for as ſin is to the Soul, as ſickneſs is to the Body; ſo the purging out of theſe corrupt luſts, is to the Soul, what this purging Phyſick is to the Diſeaſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2, <hi>Every branch in me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will purge, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> In <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.3. it is propheſied, <hi>That God will ſit as a Refiner, and as a Purifier of Silver; and purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>that they may offer unto the Lord, an offering in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Now this purging, and emptying the heart of the evil treaſure that is in it, is all one with mortification; and wherever, and in whom ſoever this is neglected, that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and commendable practice of abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the External duties of Religion, avails nothing, to Soul-proſperity: Ye ſee this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. Nay, though the Soul be alive to Chriſt, yet if this be neglected, the Soul proſpers not. This is evident in thoſe Church members in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99371:84"/>
               <hi>Corinth. Paul</hi> ſuppoſed them to be in Chriſt: Yet their unmortified luſts, clearly proved it againſt them, that they did not thrive, their Souls did not proſper. They were but Babes in Chriſt: They were in a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe, in reſpect to what they ought to have been, and might have been, but very Carnal ſtill, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 3. This then ought to be taken notice of, that beſides the real foundation of univerſal mortification, that is laid in at firſt, in the Soul's Converſion to Chriſt, wherein the abſolute, and un-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Reign of Original ſin is broken; yet the continual exerciſe of mortification, is to be minded, and taken up, otherwiſe it is not like to go well with the Soul. For it is in this caſe, as it was with the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.12. Though their Dominion was taken away, yet their lives were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for a ſeaſon. So it is here; for Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin is like Leaven, which being mingled with the Dough, the Bread will always, more or leſs, taſte of it. So that the moſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Chriſtian hath ſtill more mortifying work on his hands, which he muſt diſpatch. Thoſe that are in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the things of the Spirit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. Yet are preſſed to a further progreſs in this duty, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13,—<hi>but if ye, through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:99371:84"/>
            <p>This in general.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When by communing with our own hearts, and obſerving the out-goings of our own Spirits, we clearly ſee that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the tranſgreſſors, not among the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; I mean, among the ſick, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſound, then ſpeedily and ſeriouſly to ſet our ſelves to the uſe of ſuch purging, and mortifying means, as Chriſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in his word.</p>
            <p>And here I deſire you to note, that the means appointed, in this caſe, to be uſed, come under a double conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Some there are, which we may not deſire, nor adventure upon, but as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, according to the condition we are in, calls us to make uſe of.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There are other means, which, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our condition be, we ought, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and daily, to apply our ſelves, to make uſe of, as the matter requires; and upon ſpecial occaſions, in a manner more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>
            <p>For the former of theſe, they are of two ſorts.
<list>
                  <item>(1.) The Evil of Affliction. And</item>
                  <item>(2.) The Evil of Sin.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Evil of Affliction, of what kind ſoever it be, or for what cauſe ſoever, it comes to be our portion, whether upon our own Perſonal account; or upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99371:85"/>account of Religion. Theſe are the means, that God makes uſe of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.35, <hi>And ſome of them of underſtanding ſhall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white.</hi> Iſa. 27.9, <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away their ſin.</hi> And they are fit means, for they have a great tendency to awaken the Conſcience, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, <hi>And they ſaid one to another, we are verily guilty concerning our Brother.</hi> To break the unrulineſs of our Spirits, and to make us willing to hearken to what God ſpeaks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, in his word, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15, <hi>I will go, and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face: in their affliction, they will ſeek me early.</hi> And therefore, when God is pleaſed to exerciſe us this way, we ought to improve them for this end. And it is a great aggravation of ſin, and a great evidence of an heart greatly unmortified, not to do it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs, I was wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, in the way of his heart.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> Mic. 6.9. Yet for all this, we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come under the laſh of any of God's Rods, when we are free, in hope that we may thus improve them: For who knows afore-hand, but that when he hath his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99371:85"/>and is under the Rod, that it will not either be with him, as it was with <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22, <hi>And in the time of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he did treſpaſs yet more againſt the Lord. This is that King</hi> Ahaz. Or otherwiſe with him, that it was with <hi>Nabal,</hi> whoſe heart was as unſenſible in him as a ſtone, during the time of his ſickneſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. This we are ſure of, that there needs an Almighty power to work with them, to make them have any effectual influence, to purge out ſo much as one of thoſe luſts, which hinder the well-fare, and proſperity of the Soul. And what ground we have to hope that God will put forth any ſuch power, with any of his Rods, eſpecially, when we our ſelves, without any call from God, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for them, and deſired them, would be well conſidered of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Evil of Affliction is not to be deſired for this end, but only to be made uſe of, for this end, when God brings it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: So it is with the Evil of Sin. God is pleaſed often to make uſe of his peoples miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, to work much this way, bringing Soul-health out of Soul-ſickneſs. Thus God wrought with <hi>Peter.</hi> Compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33. with <hi>John</hi> 21.15. And with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26, Hezekiah <hi>humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart.</hi> And thus he wrought with <hi>David.</hi> That great ſin of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99371:86"/>his, through the mighty working of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon his heart, occaſioned as great exerciſe of his Repentance, and of his Faith, as ever he gave any evidence of, in the whole time of his life, from the firſt day of his Converſion, to the time of his Death. So that inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> his ſorrow was ſo deep, that he was in danger to have been ſwallowed up by it.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord is pleaſed to work; as we have heard that skilful Phyſicians, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of Art, can temper poiſonful ingredients into wholeſome Medicines. But this is proper for them only to medle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that are skilful in their Art. So this is a divine skill proper only to the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of Souls. But this we may not apply our ſelves unto: I mean, not to give way to ſin in hope that Faith and Repentance may thereby be ſet on work, and our Souls proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the better after it. No: No Man ought to give way to the leaſt ſin, though he had the greateſt ground of hope that might be, that he might be preſerved thereby from a greater ſin. It's true, in reſpect of the evil of ſuffering, when there is no remedy, but one of them muſt be choſen, the leſs may be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to avoid the greater. But in reſpect of the evil of ſin, we ought not to ſwallow a Gnat, in hope thereby to avoid a Camel. Not to take up a Moat, in hope thereby to ſhift off
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99371:86"/>the Beam, but ſtand out againſt all, and leave the ſucceſs to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. I once met with a godly Man, who being in great heavineſs under the ſenſe of the hardneſs of his heart, was tempted to adventure upon ſome great ſin, and then his heart would melt, and break preſently: But the Lord graciouſly preſerved him, and wrought in him that tenderneſs, in a great meaſure, which he deſired; whereas yielding to that temptation, had been the way, to have been hardened, by the deceit of ſin; as that young Man Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſpeaks of, who being in much anguiſh of ſpirit, for his wicked courſe of life, and often reſolving upon a courſe of Reformation, was tempted to do but once more as he had done, and then he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be troubled more: He yielded to the temptation, and he was never troubled any more as he had been, but was given up, to work all iniquity with greedineſs. We ſee then, it is God's ſole Prerogative to bring Good out of Evil; and (as I ſaid) Soul-health, out of Soul-ſickneſs. But this way we ought to abhor: Only, when this comes to be our ſad condition, we ought to do as <hi>Manaſſes</hi> did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13, <hi>When he was in Affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly,—And prayed unto him.</hi> He beſought the Lord, and he prayed, that is, he prayed, and he prayed,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99371:87"/>and humbled himſelf greatly. So did <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee, there are ſome means we ought not to adventure upon, in hope to make uſe of them, for the proſpering of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are ſome other means, which ought immediately, and daily (though at ſome times more ſolemnly then others) to be made uſe of, according as we find that we have contracted any guilt, or defilement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Souls, either great, or ſmall, more or leſs, and that is in the renewed exerciſe of Repentance, and Faith, to apply our ſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he would waſh us, and purge us both from the one, and the other.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In the renewed exerciſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and godly ſorrow, reallizing the ſad conſequences, that may poſſibly follow, and are very likely to follow the leaſt ſin that is ſlighted, and indulged. Thus <hi>Job</hi> 42.6, <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt, and aſhes.</hi> He was no vile perſon, he had not committed any groſs ſins; but guilty he was of many unadviſed ſpeeches; of ſome mixture of that corruption, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that grace, wherein he was ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, I mean of impatience; and of diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as to God's delivering him. Theſe were his failings, and for theſe he renewed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99371:87"/>the exerciſe of his Repentance, even to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring himſelf, ſo as he was vile in his own eyes, whilſt he was pretious in the eyes of God. This is a great Purger, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11, <hi>For behold this ſelf-ſame thing, that ye ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> Jam. 4.8, <hi>Cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts, ye double-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the exerciſe of Faith, that draws, and purges. Hereby virtue is drawn from Chriſt: As that Diſeaſed Woman ſaid, and found it by experience, when ſhe touched him. It was the touch of Faith, by which her fountain of blood was ſtopped, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.28, 29. Thus faith alſo purifies, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. That which we have <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to this purpoſe. Chriſt is ſaid to be the Sun of Righteouſneſs: And when he ariſeth, and ſhineth, upon the Soul, he ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with healing in his wings. What are theſe wings? The wings of the natural Sun, are the beams of the Sun, whereby light and heat are conveyed from the Sun. And the wings of the myſtical Sun, the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, are the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt. Theſe are the healers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.8. There were the waters of the Sanctuary, which healed the waters of the Sea. When theſe waters have free courſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99371:88"/>(according to what the Apoſtle prayed for, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1.) ſo as they meet with no ſtop in the mouths of the Miniſters, nor in the hearts of the people, their healing efficacy will evidently appear. It is ſaid indeed in the fore-mentioned chapter of <hi>Ezekiel. v.</hi> 11. that the miry places were not healed. In ſuch places, where the water hath not its free courſe, but ſtops, it mingles with the ſofter parts of the Earth, and makes Mire. So the truths of the Goſpel, though they meet with no ſtop in the mouths of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; yet if they meet with obſtructions in the hearts of the hearers, ſo as the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit are not obſerved, and the operations of the Spirit reſiſted: Then cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption mingles even with the word it ſelf, turning the freeneſs of the grace of Chriſt into wantonneſs, and the efficacy of his grace into lazineſs. This makes a miry, polluted, dirty Soul. Therefore as ever we deſire that our Souls ſhould proſper, and thrive as a watered Garden, according to that promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. See that theſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have a free paſſage: Let faith be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon thoſe truths, which hold forth the freeneſs, and riches of the grace of Chriſt: For thoſe are the truths, the Prophet ſaw in his Viſion, repreſented by thoſe waters. And let this be in conjunction with the exerciſe of Repentance. This is the way, by the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99371:88"/>Spirit of grace, working with theſe truths, whereby Souls are healed and purged, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22, <hi>Seeing ye have purified your Souls, in obeying the truth, through the Spirit.</hi> Theſe were the truths, by obedience whereunto, their Souls were purified.</p>
            <p>This is the way, whereby the Lord firſt begins to heal, and purge the Soul. For this I ſhall give you but one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is a place to be taken notice of. It is 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.19. Wherein note three things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God intending, according to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal purpoſe, to heal ſome ſick, quicken ſome dead, ſave ſome loſt Souls, declares his purpoſe to do it, by way of Reconciling them to himſelf. This he will do, before they ſhall be poſſeſſed of that Salvation, he hath choſen them unto. His method is firſt to purge their Souls, mortifying that enmity that is in their hearts, both againſt his ways, and their own good, and ſo to reduce them to terms of Reconciliation with himſelf, and make them willing to be Reconciled unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) How God will do this, <hi>[God was in Chriſt.]</hi> The Divine Nature aſſumed the Human Nature, and ſo in, and through Chriſt, God-Man, in one Perſon offers terms of Love, and Peace to them, as the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way to prevail upon them, and to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99371:89"/>bring their Souls about to him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) But in what peculiar way will he more tranſcendently manifeſt this grace, and mercy? The Text tells us, he will do it <hi>[in not imputing their iniquities;]</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and promiſing a full, and everlaſting pardon, of all ſin, never to be called in, if his terms be accepted of: And the ſinner being made willing to be Reconciled unto God. Thus he ſubdues the heart, conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by Love. And thus the work of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and cleanſing the Soul is begun, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47, <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> And as thus it is begun, ſo upon a failure, it is renewed, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. When a Soul that is Diſeaſed, and polluted, is awakened to apply himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, in the exerciſe of Faith, and Repentance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way, that the waters of the Sanctuary, the Spirit of grace, and the Goſpel of grace may not be ſtopt in their courſe, but have a free paſſage into the Soul, the hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God is raiſed greatly, and that ſtirs up the Soul to purifie himſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, <hi>Every one that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf.</hi> Obſerve that [He puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelf.] This is neceſſary: For as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is moſt effectual to purge out corrupt humours, when Nature works with it (for it is to no purpoſe to give it to a dead Man,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99371:89"/>and when Nature is quite ſpent in a ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it comes too late.) So it is here. The Soul that thus applies it ſelf to Chriſt, will find his blood to be a healing, purging, ſin-mortifying blood. But in applying our ſelves thereunto, our own thoughts, and affections; our own endeavours, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions againſt all occaſions of ſin, againſt the firſt riſings of ſin; and we muſt apply our ſelves to what mortifying means we find preſcribed, and have been found to be of uſe to others. All theſe we muſt ſet on work, and then the Spirit of God, will work with us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13,—<hi>if ye through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> And doing thus, we may be ſaid, To purge our ſelves, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.21. If we do thus, <hi>We ſhall be Veſſels of honour, fit for the Maſter's uſe:</hi> That is, our Souls ſhall proſper.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt thing, that I have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you, as ye mind the well-fare, and proſperity of your Souls, to mind this. There is another kind of Phyſick, to be made uſe of, as the matter requires, and that is Cordials; for the healing of a fainting Soul. This may be ſpoken unto hereafter; when I have firſt ſpoken unto what is, moſt times, to be made uſe of, betwixt this of Purging, and that of Cordials.</p>

            <head>SERMON VIII.</head>
            <p n="2">2. THe next thing that I ſhall take notice of, as neceſſary for the health, and well-fare of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which as the Lord ſhall enable me, I ſhall apply to the point in hand) is the obſerving of a good Diet; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the choice of meats, ſuch, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, have been found, beſt agreeable to the Nature, and Conſtitution of the Body; and in proportion, ſuitable to the natural heat of our ſtomachs, for Concoction, and Digeſtion. This is a great means of health, eſpecially for ſuch as are naturally weak, and infirm. For, uſually, as is our Food, ſo is our Blood; as is our Blood, ſo are our Spirits; and as are our Spirits, ſo are our Bodies for health, or ſickneſs; for ſtrength, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now, as I told you, what in a natural way is for the health and well-fare of the Body, is, in a ſpiritual way, applicable to the health, and well-fare of the Soul. I ſhewed you, that it was ſo, in that which I ſpake laſt unto. I am now to ſhew, it is ſo in this. In order hereunto, we muſt take notice,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99371:90"/>that as God hath provided (and that, with great variety) Food and nouriſhment for the preſervation of the Natural life of our Bodies: So he hath, for the preſervation of the Spiritual life of our Soul; and that ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the degree that our Souls have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto. <hi>Heb,</hi> 5.13, 14, <hi>Milk for Babes, Meat for ſtrong Men. Food that endures to Eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.27. Such Food as is a Feaſt, whereupon the Soul may feed, and fare deliciouſly every day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6,—<hi>a Feaſt of fat things, a Feaſt of Wine on the Lees,</hi> &amp;c. This is a matter we are much concerned in. That we know both our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and our Duty herein, ſomething muſt be ſaid to each of theſe four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
<list>
                  <item>1. What that Food is, which God hath provided, for the health, and proſperity of our Souls.</item>
                  <item>2. What thoſe Means are, whereby that Food is conveyed unto us.</item>
                  <item>3. Something, by way of argument, to quicken our Spiritual Appetite after it.</item>
                  <item>4. Something by way of Direction, how to feed upon it, ſo as to receive that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from it, which our Souls ſtand in need of.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe. That Food which God hath provided for us, is Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but Jeſus Chriſt eſpecially as Crucified.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:99371:91"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) This Food is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. For the proof of this, conſider, that Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>The tree of life,</hi> Revel. 2.7. And the <hi>Hidden Manna,</hi> verſ. 17. Both which were Types of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He is ſaid to be <hi>The tree of life,</hi> in alluſion to that tree, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Tree of Life, not for any Natural, or Phyſical excellency in it, to preſerve life, more then other Trees, but only as it was a Seal of the Covenant of works; a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seal of that Eternity of Life, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> might with all fullneſs of confidence have expected, if he had perſevered in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to what was required of him. But it is upon another account, that Jeſus Chriſt is called, The Tree of life, becauſe he hath life in himſelf, and quickeneth whom he will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. And with the Food that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, nouriſheth, and preſerveth that life (where he hath quickened it) unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, ſo that it never runs into death. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. He is ſaid to be a Tree of Life, on both ſides of the River of the Water of Life. But one Tree, yet reacheth to both ſides of the River; ſo that all, from what quarter ſoever they come, may receive Food, and nouriſhment from him. And though but one Tree, yet it bare twelve kinds of Fruit, which ſetteth forth the variety of Spiritual priviledges, and graces, which Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99371:91"/>hath to give forth for the proſperity of the Soul, according to all its concernments. Thus as he is the Tree of Life, he is for the Food of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He is ſo, as he is ſaid to be, <hi>The hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna,</hi> Rev. 2.17. Manna, ye know, was their Bread in the Wilderneſs fourty years together. It is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.25. to be Angels Food, whether for the excellency of it, that it was for them to have fed upon, if they had ſtood in any need of it: Or whether it was prepared for them, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Angels; This need not be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This is certain, it was a Type of Chriſt, who ſaith of himſelf, That he was the living Bread that came down from Heaven: And he is ſaid to be, The hidden Manna; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly alluding to that Pot of Manna, which was hidden in the Ark of the Teſtimony, pointing at Chriſt, as hidden Food, altogether unknown to the unbelieving World, who never had ſo much as a real taſte of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of his grace, of the efficacy of his Death, or the power of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as it was in reference to Manna: All thoſe that in the exerciſe of Faith did eat of it, under that conſideration, as a Type of Chriſt, it was ſpiritual meat to them. So the water out of the Rock, to all thoſe that in the ſame manner, under the ſame conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, did drink of it, was ſpiritual drink,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99371:92"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. Even ſo is Jeſus Chriſt, at this day, and will be to the end of the World; his fleſh will be meat indeed, and his blood will be drink indeed, to all thoſe that feed upon him by faith. And this leads me to the ſecond Particular.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That Jeſus Chriſt is this Food, which is appointed for the nouriſhment of the Soul, as he is a Crucified Saviour. Even as we read of the Manna, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.8. that it was prepared to be eaten, by being firſt ground in the Mill, or beaten in a Mortar, and ſo baked in a Pan. And as the Rock was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> before the water guſhed out, ſo it was, at firſt, by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6. And the Paſchal Lamb was roaſted at the fire, before it was eaten. Even ſo Jeſus Chriſt was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, ſmitten of God unto death, that ſo he might be ſpiritual Food for Souls, according to the Father's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This was the ground of <hi>Paul</hi>'s reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, He determined, to know nothing, (<hi>i. e.</hi> to make known unto them nothing, comparatively) but Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified. And indeed the firſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſight that a humbled ſinner hath of Chriſt, when his heart works after him, for the life and Food of his Soul is, as he was clothed with his Garments of Blood, made a Curſe for ſinners, as obedient unto death.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99371:92"/>This was always the ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi>'s preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, firſt to ſet forth Chriſt as Crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. So he preached him, and ſo he deſired that thoſe who were his hearers might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. So the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, wherein ſpiritual Food is adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a believing Soul, the ſcope thereof is <hi>to ſhew forth the Lord's death, till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. And this upon the higheſt ground of reaſon, for as Jeſus Chriſt, by his blood redeemed our Souls from a ſtate of ſpiritual death, to a ſtate of ſpiritual life, breaking down the partition-wall, not only between Jews, and Gentiles, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Sinners, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. So he purchaſed thereby, not only a full diſcharge from the guilt of ſin, by the imputation of his own righteouſneſs, but power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, from his own fullneſs, continual ſupplies of ſpiritual life, for the daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Soul-proſperity. For whatever we receive for our All, is to be received from Chriſt, as riſing again from the dead, as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into Heaven, as making interceſſion for thoſe that come to God by him, and whatever influence Chriſt in his Offices, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet hath into the life, and nouriſhment of our Souls, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all was laid in this, that Chriſt was a Crucified Saviour. His interceſſion is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, becauſe his blood ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99371:93"/>As the great Prophet of his Church, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the counſel of his Father, in all that is neceſſary to be known, to make us wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, for that he merited this by his blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5, 6. Becauſe the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> was the Lamb ſlain, therefore he prevailed to open the book of God's ſecret Council, which no man elſe was found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to open, or to read, or ſo much as to look upon, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. His reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for the declaring of our juſtification; but that is, becauſe he firſt dyed for our ſins.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the ſecond particular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt head, proved unto you. That as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is appointed for the food of our Souls, ſo Jeſus Chriſt ſpecially as crucified. Even as at this day, thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, which by God's allowance we feed upon, muſt firſt loſe their own lives before they can be for ſupport to ours; Even ſo it is here. No life from Chriſt, but by the death of Chriſt. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, Joh. 6.53. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now proceed to what in the ſecond place, was propoſed, which was to ſhew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What are the ways and means, by which Jeſus Chriſt conveys this ſpiritual life unto the ſoul, that it may live and proſper.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:99371:93"/>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> It is by the powerful working of his Holy Spirit, ſprinkling all Ordinances, all Providences, and the Soul it ſelf that receives nouriſhment from Chriſt, with the merits, and efficacy of the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) All Ordinances, in the uſe of them he is ſaid, to ſet meat before us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. Meat which is compared to thoſe things that are nouriſhing to the Body, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3, <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend your Money for that which is not Bread? &amp;c.</hi> The word is compared to Honey (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103, <hi>How ſweet are thy words to my taſte? yea ſweeter then honey to my mouth</hi>) and preferred before it. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.13, <hi>My Son, eat thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney becauſe it is good, and the honey-comb, which is ſweet to thy taſte.</hi> And it is found by experience, that Honey is good, and the Honey-comb is ſweet to the taſte. But the word is ſweeter then the Honey, which of its own accord drops from the Honey-comb, without any preſſing, which is reckoned the ſweeteſt of all. What is particularly, is ſaid of the Promiſes, in a ſenſe, is true of all the Ordinances, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.16. In theſe things we live, in them is the life of our Spirits. The whole word is ſaid to be <hi>The word of life,</hi> Act. 5.20. Thus the Lord feeds the Soul, according to that promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14. <hi>I will feed them with the heritage of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Father.</hi> What was that? It was the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99371:94"/>good things of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but not with them alone, but with that whereof they were a Type, the Heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, together with all things relating thereunto; the Promiſes, not only of this life, but alſo of the life to come. They were part of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s heritage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20, <hi>He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes, and his ordinances unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is one way, whereby food for the Soul is conveyed from Chriſt. Therefore it is, that Paſtors, in their adminiſtrations, are ſaid To feed the Church. It is upon that account, that they are called Paſtors. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. But this is only ſo far, as they are ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt. Otherwiſe, as there is a vanity in the Creatures, when God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf from them; ſo there is in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13, <hi>Bring no more vain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> As the merits of Chriſt purchaſe our Spiritual life, ſo they purchaſe a bleſſing upon that food, which is for nouriſhment of it: <hi>Rebecca</hi> may dreſs the Veniſon, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> gives the bleſſing. So it is here, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24, <hi>In all places, where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and bleſs thee.</hi> Gal. 2.8, <hi>He that wrought effectually in</hi> Peter, <hi>to the Apoſtleſhip of the Circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me toward the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As in all his Ordinances, ſo in all his Providences, when ſprinkled with the blood
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99371:94"/>of Chriſt, there is likewiſe meat laid before us, even in every one of them, of what ſort ſoever. Obſervable to this purpoſe, is that which we have <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.9, <hi>They ſhall go in, and out, and find paſture.</hi> Going in, and out, according to Scripture expreſſion, ſet forth all the turnings, and various paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of a Man's life. So we underſtand that promiſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.6, <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be, when thou comeſt in, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be, when thou goeſt out.</hi> Which is renewed again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.8, <hi>The Lord ſhall preſerve thy going out, and thy coming in.</hi> There is good feeding to be had in all theſe, even where it might be leaſt looked for, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.14. God promiſeth, <hi>That he will feed the flock of his heritage with his rod.</hi> This is hard feeding; but bleſſed be the Lord, it hath proved, and will prove again, good and wholeſome nouriſhment, when ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt: for thereby he hath purchaſed a fruitful, and ſanctified uſe of the Rod. Chriſt being a Mediatour in reference to the rod, as well as in reference to the word: when it is ſo, then dark and cloudy Providences falling down in ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which (as we ſay) wet a Man to the skin, nay even reach the very heart, coming near unto it, and cutting deep into it, yet they drop fatneſs, and though they make the way foul, yet they make the Land
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99371:95"/>fruitful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10, <hi>God chaſtens us for our profit, that we may be partakers of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Then meat is found in the eater, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable nouriſhment in the croſs, when we can ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23 4,—<hi>thy rod, and thy ſtaff comfort me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As both in Providences, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thus ſprinkled, nouriſhment is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Soul: So the Soul that receives this nouriſhment, muſt be ſprinkled with the ſame blood. There muſt be (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12:23.) a coming to the blood of ſprinkling, in the exerciſe of Faith; for thereby it is, that food, or vertue to feed, is diſtributed into them all, and ſo conveyed unto the Soul. Even as the Root of the Tree draws ſap from the Earth, and then concocts it, and ſends it forth to all the boughs, and branches, which if they receive not, they wither; ſo it is here. It is not any one Providence, or Ordinance; no, if we take them all in conjunction together, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole, or in part, convey any nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the Soul, but as ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt; and made uſe of, as ſubordinate means in his hands, and as made effectual by the exerciſe of Faith, drawing in all our expectations of any Spiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, from any of theſe, into Chriſt alone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, <hi>They all drank the ſame Spiritual drink (for they drank of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99371:95"/>Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt) They did all eat the ſame meat.</hi> Some had the food, but not the nouriſhment; they had not this ſprinkling, for <hi>ver.</hi> 5, <hi>With many of them, God was not well pleaſed.</hi> So it may be with any of us, at this day: Though we have cauſe, with all thankfulneſs, to acknowledge, as <hi>David</hi> did, in another caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.5, <hi>Thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareſt a Table before me, in the preſence of mine enemies.</hi> To their great grief, and vexation, who thought they had ſhut the Door, ſo as no Man ſhould have opened it: but God hath opened it, ſo as none of them can, as yet, ſhut it; ſo that we are not ſcanted in proviſion for our Souls; yet as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine did not proſper ever the better for their feeding in a Meadow, and eating up the fat Kine: Even ſo will it be with our Souls, unleſs we feed upon Chriſt. In the uſe of Paſture, and all other means of feeding, they will ſtill be lean, and ill-favoured. So that, if we were ſenſible of it, we ſhould ſee cauſe to complain, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth, <hi>My leanneſs, my leanneſs,</hi> Iſa. 24.16. God will deal with us, as he did with them, when he gave them the food they luſted after, though they had it, yet he ſent leanneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Souls: Inſtead of nouriſhing them, a deadly conſumption came along with it, as <hi>Num.</hi> 11.33. Pray that we may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99371:96"/>from this Judgment, that we may not (as it is ſaid in our common Proverb) ſtarve in a Cook's ſhop. And this leads me to the</p>
            <p n="3">3. Third Particular: What arguments are there to quicken our Spiritual appetite to this food? Of many that might be given, I ſhall only mention theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This is food, that may eaſily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Many are put hard to it, for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence for themſelves, and their Families. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6.7, <hi>All the labour of Man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</hi> But it is not ſo here; this is prepared, ready for us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. <hi>I have prepared my Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: mine Oxen, and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready.</hi> And freely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is but, <hi>Come, and eat,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. 'Tis true, we are commanded to labour for this food, more then for any thing elſe that the World affords, what need ſoever we ſtand in of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27, <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto you.</hi> But it is with a labour like that of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, ſweet, eaſie, and delightful. The very labouring after it, affords more content, and ſatisfaction to the Soul (truly ſo called) then any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comfort whatſoever, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is no other food for our Souls
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99371:96"/>but this; we muſt feed upon it, or ſtarve. Any thing that God appoints, may ſupply the want of bodily food. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2, 3,— <hi>Man doth not live by Bread alone, but by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth Man live.</hi> But nothing can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of Chriſt. They that feed upon any thing elſe, expecting any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouriſhment, do but (as they <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20.) <hi>feed on aſhes.</hi> And indeed the complexion of ſome Mens Souls, ſhews what their diet is, ſo Earthly, &amp;c. As young folks under ſome bodily Diſtemper, eat Chalk, or Lime, &amp;c. How ill do they look? Make the beſt of it, To feed upon any thing elſe is but periſhing food, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. And as well may we think that fiſhes of the Sea may live in the Air, or the beaſts of the Field in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, as that the Soul may live, and proſper by any thing, either Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Ordinances, without feeding upon Chriſt in them.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) There needs no other food, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55, <hi>For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> And as all the ſweetneſs, deſirableneſs, and matter of nouriſhment that is in the meat, is for the health, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Body: So whatever is in Chriſt, and whatever Chriſt is, (and Chriſt is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovely) <hi>quantus, quantus est,</hi> all is for the life and health, ſtrength and proſperity
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99371:97"/>of the Soul. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. It is ſaid, He came into the World, that is to live, and dye in the World, to do and ſuffer, what was to be done, and ſuffered, that dead Souls might live, and living Souls have life in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; that is, might live, and proſper.</p>
            <p>Whether we conſider Chriſt in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in his Offices, we ſhall ſee in both, that there, and there alone, food is to be had for our Souls.</p>
            <p>Before I mention either of theſe, I ſhall firſt lay before you this Propoſition.</p>
            <p>That whatſoever may encourage a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner, experimentally under clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, that there is no poſſibility of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in an Unregenerate ſtate, and fully ſatisfieth him, that all Salvation is to be had in Chriſt, and without him, no Salvation at all; whatſoever I ſay, may encourage ſuch a Perſon, under great uncertainties, whether Chriſt will accept of him, or no, to come unto him, to caſt himſelf down at the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of his grace, into the arms of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to depend upon him, and abide in him for all, that may give him a Title to, and a fitneſs for Heaven. And</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Whatever may eſtabliſh ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon, having thus adventured his Eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in the hands of Chriſt, in a good hope, through grace, that he ſhall receive ſuch help and aſſiſtance from the Spirit of Chriſt, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99371:97"/>he ſhall perſevere unto the end, both in the love that God bears unto him, and in the grace that he hath wrought in him, ſo as the good work begun in him, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: Where that is to be found which hath an influence into all this; there, certainly, food is to be had, for the life, health, and proſperity of our Souls. This needs no proof, ye will all aſſent to it.</p>
            <p>Now, that all this is to be found in Chriſt, and in him alone, will appear, whether we conſider him in his Perſon, or in his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In his Perſon, as God and Man in one Perſon. This is the great myſtery of Godlineſs, as hath been, heretofore, at large opened unto you, from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, Of all Goſpel-myſteries, this is the greateſt. That a loſt ſinner ſhould have ſuch a Saviour, that is as verily Man, as God, and as verily God, as Man. That the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, that were, at firſt, at ſuch a diſtance, ſhould meet in one perſon. The ſerious conſideration of this, hath much of Spiritual nouriſhment in it. It will appear to be ſo, when we have weighed theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What the work was, which Chriſt came into the World to do. It was to be a Mediatour between God, and Man. A Mediatour of Reconciliation between a moſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99371:98"/>holy God, moſt highly provoked: and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinners, ſtill continuing in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. This was his great work, that was upon his hands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That this affords great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo to come to Chriſt, as being, upon this account, able to ſave to the uttermoſt. Hereby we ſee, that what he either did, or ſuffered, though but in his human Nature, though but for a little while, the whole time of his continuing viſibly in the World, being but 33 years (rather to ſpeak exactly, but 32 years, and a half) was of infinite value and efficacy; which did ariſe from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his two Natures; becauſe the Perſon, though in the form of a Man, was the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that Did ſuch things, and Suffered ſuch things. Now this is a great relief to Faith; yea ſuch may be the temptation, that a humbled ſinner may be under, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can relieve, or afford any nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo much (as we uſe to ſay) to keep Life, and Soul together. For ſuppoſe this to be the caſe,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>John Hardy</hi> of <hi>Symondsbury.</hi>
               </note> as once it was, of a godly Miniſter in this County, who dyed but this laſt Summer. I had the Relation of it from himſelf, who was, for a time, in a great Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99371:98"/>and this was his temptation: Why, ſaid Conſcience (and Satan too, who ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Curtain) Thy ſins deſerve an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite puniſhment, for thou haſt ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an infinite God, and thou deſerveſt Eternal death. And that Chriſt, in whom thou truſteſt, he being Man, and ſuffering only in his human Nature, he could ſuffer only that which is finite. And the time of his ſuffering was but ſhort. How then can he by ſuffering ſo ſhort a time, deliver from infinite ſuffering, and Eternal death? This, as he told me, was the temptation that lay upon him, and how he was relieved. Even thus; The Lord brought it to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſet it home with a Divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his Spirit: That though Chriſt ſuffered only in his Human Nature; and though therefore all his ſufferings were but finite; yet becauſe the Human Nature was United, in one Perſon, to the Divine Nature; hence, what the Human Nature did ſuffer, though but for a time, was of ſufficient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to ranſome from Eternal death. In ſuch a caſe, nothing elſe could have done it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can ſupport any Soul, in ſuch a condition. But this may, and this will, if believed, and wrought upon the heart, that the Lord hath <hi>laid help upon one that is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Pſal. 89.19.</p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:99371:99"/>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider Chriſt, in his Offices.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In his Prieſtly Office. <hi>He is a great High-Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 4.14. Great, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Satisfaction, and of his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; which are the two ſpecial parts of his Prieſtly Office. From both which, much Spiritual Food, for the nouriſhment of the Soul, unto the higheſt degree of proſperity it is capable of, may be received.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the ſatisfaction he hath made, to the juſtice of God, for all the wrong that ſin hath done him, by the ſacrifice which he offered, which was Himſelf, unto death. <hi>With this, God was well pleaſed,</hi> Eph. 5.2. And for this, he ſhall ſee the Souls of all his Seed to proſper, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. Hereby <hi>his fleſh became meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed.</hi> This clearly manifeſts, that Chriſt is ſuch an object for Faith to reſt upon, as we may ſafely adventure our Eternal ſtate upon. For let any Man conceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in as ſad a condition, as the fears of an awakened Conſcience can ſuggeſt. Suppoſe he ſees the guilt of all his ſins before him, with all their aggravating circumſtances, and apprehends God coming out againſt him, to require ſatisfaction, to his juſtice, for them all. This is a dreadful ſight, but in the midſt of all the heighth, and depth of that terrour, which this may impreſs upon his Spirit; if God give in a ſight of Chriſt,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99371:99"/>as the great High-Prieſt, as he made his Soul an Offering for ſin; this is enough to draw forth an hearty act of dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as able to ſave to the uttermoſt. This ſupported <hi>David,</hi> when he was in great depths, that he had a ſight of him, that in the Lord was plenteous Redemption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.1, 2. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. This was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the hunger-bitten Prodigal, <hi>That in his Father's houſe was bread enough,</hi> Luk. 15.17. And it was the ſpeech of a gracious Woman, of whom I have heard not long ſince, that upon her Death-bed, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great uncertainties, as to her Eternal condition. <hi>Did not ye tell me,</hi> ſaid ſhe, to thoſe that ſtood by her, <hi>that the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſins?</hi> And with that her Spirit Revived, and ſhe ſlept ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Lord. This, indeed, may well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Conſcience, for it ſatisfies God himſelf; yea ſo far ſatisfie Conſcience as to go bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Throne of Grace, for what grace, or mercy ſoever is neceſſary, for the life, and health, well-fare, and proſperity of the Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16, <hi>Let us therefore come bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As from Chriſts ſatisfaction, which he made to the juſtice of God, whilſt he was upon Earth; ſo from the other act of his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99371:100"/>Prieſtly Office, his Interceſſion which he makes in Heaven for ſinners, much Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Food for the nouriſhment of our Souls may be had. What ſhould hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it, but our daily repeated failings, and often renewed infirmities? But againſt the guilt of theſe, Chriſt's appearing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us, prevails, that even when the Law is broken, the Covenant is not broken; ſo that what Food for our Souls may be had from the Covenant (and there it is all to be had, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. And he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>) His interceſſion is as effectual as his ſatisfaction, for he intercedes in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, <hi>The blood of Chriſt ſpeaketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew further, That all in Chriſt is for the food and nouriſhment of the Soul, much, yea very much may be ſaid of that, which his Kingly Office affords, and likewiſe his Prophetical Office.</p>
            <p>For his Kingly Office, he hath an abſolute Soveraignty over all, both Men, and Devils, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Far above all Principalities, and Powers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath all things under his feet. He is head over all things to his Church.</hi> Underſtand it of the Inviſible Church eſpecially, which is his Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof he is the head. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23, <hi>For
<pb facs="tcp:99371:100"/>the Husband is the head of the Wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church: And he is the Saviour of the Body.</hi> This is full of Spiritual Food. I will inſtance only in three things, by which the proſperity of the Soul is exceedingly farthered.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As he hath power over Satan. This affords great relief to a conflicting Soul, that he both can, and will break the Serpents head, and tread him under foot, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. That in <hi>Manlius</hi> is memorable to this purpoſe, Satan (as he tells the ſtory) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a godly Man that was ſick, in the habit of a Prieſt, with Pen, Ink, and Paper in his hands, and told him that he muſt confeſs all his Sins to him, he would write them down, and then he would abſolve him. The Sick Man was ſtricken with fear (and no marvel) but recollecting himſelf, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving who he was; If thou wilt write, ſaith he, write this firſt, The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head, and with that, the Devil vaniſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As he hath Soveraignty over the Heart. He can <hi>take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. A great relief this, when the Soul is mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the hardneſs of his heart, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Chriſt is exalted to be a Prince, to give Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) As he hath the Keys of Hell, and
<pb facs="tcp:99371:101"/>Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. A great relief to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Soul, that is under the fear, firſt of Death; and then of dropping into Hell, when he is dead. Thoſe that have obeyed the call, and are ſtill obeying the call of Chriſt, they ſhall none of them dye, till it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to dye then to live, for death is theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. And for dropping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, Chriſt hath ſecured them againſt that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40. Every one that believeth on him ſhall have Everlaſting life, and Chriſt will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Prophetical Office of Chriſt, is likewiſe a fruitful, food-bearing Office. He is engaged by Office, to make all his Seed wiſe unto Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taught of God.</hi> And he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who hath promiſed it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27, <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any Man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye.</hi> Joh. 17.26, <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This affords ſweet, refreſhing nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will inſtance only in two Caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When many things are heard, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at one time, and ſomething at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the word. And it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at this time, which is not underſtood, at leaſt, not ſo underſtood, as that the heart
<pb facs="tcp:99371:101"/>is affected with it. Here is relief to be had; he can, and undertakes to teach the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7, <hi>And I will give them an heart to know me,—for they ſhall return unto me, with their whole heart.</hi> Thus he taught <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.6.—<hi>In the hidden part, thou ſhalt make me to know wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) When a Perſon walkes in darkneſs, under many ſad fears, whether ever the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be well laid for Soul-proſperity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever he were brought into a ſtate of Union with Chriſt, ſo as to receive the firſt principles of Spiritual life from him. Here from this Office of Chriſt, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Father's mind, in all things that we are concerned to know, there is relief to be had, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19,—<hi>but ye ſee me.</hi> They were in Chriſt, their Union was begun, but they did not know it; but Chriſt undertakes, ſo as they will leave it to him, to take his own time, that one day they ſhall know it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you more largely, then at firſt I intended: That there needs no food for the Soul to feed upon, ſo as to proſper, but Chriſt alone. For as all that is nouriſhing in the meat, is for the health and well-fare of the Body; ſo all that is in Chriſt, is for the health, and well-fare of the Soul. I have very few words more to ſpeak.</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:99371:102"/>
            <p n="4">4. Of the fourth and laſt Point. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of direction: How to feed upon this food, ſo as to receive that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which our Souls ſtand in need of. I ſhall only mention theſe four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We are to apply our ſelves to this Spiritual food, with a Spiritual appetite. Natural life deſires Natural food. Appetite unto it, is called Hunger, as it deſires meat, and Thirſt as it deſires drink. So it ought to be, where there is Spiritual life, after this Spiritual food, wherein we have both Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meat, and Spiritual drink, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55, <hi>For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> And our appetite after it ought to be quick, and ſtrong: We ſhould be able to ſay as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9, <hi>With my Soul have I deſired thee in the night, and with my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will I ſeek thee early. i. e.</hi> I have moſt affectionately deſired thee, in my moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thoughts, and ſo I reſolve to do. That's the ſenſe: For when the Soul is ſaid to do that, which nothing elſe but the Soul can do, it imports the ſtrongeſt and higheſt act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Soul in doing it. Now, though that which hath been ſaid already might be ſufficient thus to quicken this appetite. That there is no other food for our Souls but this; That they muſt feed upon it, or ſtarve: Yet I ſhall farther add this: That we delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99371:102"/>conſider with our ſelves, What work God requires of us, every day; and that we labour, with our hearts, to do it as we ought. The work of every day is great, in reſpect of the inward exerciſes of grace, when not clothed with any outward duty: As, To live by faith: To ſanctifie God in our hearts: To walk in the fear of the Lord: And when we awake, to be ſtill with God; ſetting the Lord always before us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The external work of every day, is great alſo: The duties of Religion: The duties of our particular Callings, and Relations. All theſe ought to be done, ſo as to approve the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our hearts to God, and find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with his Majeſty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we labour, that whether preſent, or abſent, we may be accepted of him.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> that he laboured earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Prayers; <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. And we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>To do with our might, whatſoever our hand findeth to do,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.10. Now hard labour gets a Man a ſtomach, makes him both hungry, and thirſty. It will do ſo, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, when we ſet our ſelves to make ſomething of Religion: To work, and walk with God every day, as we ought; we ſhall be even conſtrained to cry out, Who is ſufficient for theſe things? We ſhall ſee, we need more ſpiritual food, for the nouriſhing, and ſtrengthening of our Souls.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99371:103"/>This will quicken our ſpiritual Appetite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, <hi>That we may be more and more ſtrengthened in our inward Man by his Spirit,</hi> Eph. 3.16. That we may <hi>be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> Eph. 6.10.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That in applying our ſelves to this food, we manage the matter for our Souls, as diſcreet perſons do, in making proviſions for their Families, when the Market-day comes: They conſider whether there be Bread-corn enough in the Houſe, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing elſe that is neceſſary be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and ſo, according to their ability, they provide. So ought we to do in this caſe, we ought to conſider what our Souls ſtand moſt in need of, that they may proſper. Some days we may find, we moſt of all want ſtrength againſt one corruption; ſome days more ſtrength againſt another. Some days we ſtand in more need of one grace, and ſometimes of another: ſuppoſe of Faith, or Repentance, Meekneſs or Patience; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we ought to apply our ſelves to our ſpiritual food, the Lord Jeſus, for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and ſtrength in that particular. Chriſt expects this, that we ſhould be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our particular wants: We read <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.35, 36. that a blind Man hearing that Chriſt paſſed by that way, cryed out, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Son of</hi> David. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, 41. Chriſt asks him, what he would, that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99371:103"/>he ſhould do unto him. Chriſt knew what he would deſire; but he would have him to particularize his wants. Thus we ought to apply our ſelves to Chriſt, with a ſenſe of what we want in particular. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I told you) all in Chriſt is ſome way or other, for our ſpiritual food, both Chriſt in his Perſon, and Chriſt in his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: We ſhould apply our ſelves to that in Chriſt, which may moſt of all relieve our faith in ſeeking after that particular ſupply, which, for the preſent, we ſee we need, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in his Perſon, or in his Offices, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Prieſt, or Prophet, or King. When we know there is ſuch a thing in ſuch a Cupboard, when we go to it, the next way to find what we ſeek for, is to go to the Box, wherein it is.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) What diſpenſation ſoever we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; what mercy ſoever we have received, or are receiving; what croſs ſoever we are exerciſed withal, or is likely to come upon us; what Ordinances ſoever we addreſs our felves to God in, we may ſpread the matter before God, and tell him our caſe, and our dependence upon him; and pray moſt for the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt upon all, that for the merit of his blood, it may be bleſſed unto us, ſo as it may afford ſome ſpiritual nouriſhment for our Souls; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Holy Spirit working with them,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99371:104"/>and in them, and by them. It is he alone that teacheth to profit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.17. <hi>David</hi> knew this, and therefore he prayed, That he might feel the power of God in all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Do this daily, as the matter requires; Nature will decay, if not daily repaired. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> who had eaten nothing for three days, and three nights, was faint, but when he had eaten, his ſpirit came to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.12. So it will be with the new Nature, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. The things that are ready to dye, if not fed with freſh ſupplies, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19. It was a ſore affliction, which made the Church forget to eat her bread, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.4. It is ſome ſtrong corruption, that makes us forget our ſpiritual bread, as they did forget their reſting place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.6.</p>
            <p>I conclude all with this. Our needs, if we be ſenſible of them, we cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, are very great, every day. That invitation, and encouragement is for every day, which we have, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.5, <hi>Come, eat of my bread, and drink of my wine:</hi> And <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1, <hi>Eat O friends, drink, yea drink abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, O beloved.</hi> Therefore, come and eat eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, as we deſire that every day our Souls ſhould proſper.</p>

            <p>A Third thing which I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, as neceſſary for the health and well-fare of the Body, which I intend now (as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt) to apply to the Point in hand, is this; <hi>That we be well clothed.</hi> God hath given to every living Creature ſome kind of clothing, or other: Even to the Birds of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Field. They could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the extremity either of heat, or cold without it. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> when they were at firſt created, needed no clothing, but their own innocency; when they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, God provided it for them, before they did for themſelves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. Cold, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, is very prejudicial to Man's health, and may be ſo to his life. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth it among his great ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, —<hi>in cold, and nakedneſs.</hi> Therefore up and down in the Scripture, we find it ſpoken of, as a commendable act of charity, <hi>To cloth the naked,</hi> Iſa. 58.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.30.</p>
            <p>This is one thing then we ought ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mind, as ever we deſire our Souls
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99371:105"/>ſhould proſper, that (as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.) <hi>we may not be found naked.</hi> Now, the Scripture tells us, what the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, wherewith the Soul that proſpers, muſt be clothed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8, <hi>And it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto her</hi> (the Bride, the Lamb's Wife) <hi>that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white: for the fine linnen is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Saints.</hi> This fine Linnen, this Righteouſneſs (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) comes under a double conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Righteouſneſs which is wrought for the Soul by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in his own Perſon, and is imputed to every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Righteouſneſs that is wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of Chriſt, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in every new Creature. The one may be called, The outer garment, the other, The inner garment of the heart. So far as the Soul is clothed with this double garment of Righteouſneſs, ſo far it proſpers, and no farther.</p>
            <p>Something muſt be ſaid to each of theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of that garment of Righteouſneſs, which Chriſt hath wrought for the Soul. This is that <hi>White garment</hi> Rev. 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me,—white raiment, that thou mayeſt be clothed.</hi> This is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly garment that gives a title to Heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10, <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99371:105"/>my Soul ſhall be joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me with the garments of ſalvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> This is not like <hi>Saul</hi>'s Armour, that was not fit for <hi>David;</hi> it will fit every Soul, that really feels the want of it, and indeed, and in truth, is willing to put it on; and therefore, we are exhorted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14, <hi>To put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In proſecuting of this Point, a few words to each of theſe Particulars.
<list>
                  <item>1. Conſider the materials whereof this garment is made.</item>
                  <item>2. That it is of abſolute neceſſity that it be put on, elſe the Soul cannot proſper.</item>
                  <item>3. How it is to be put on.</item>
                  <item>4. What influence it hath into Soul-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, when it is put on.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) For the firſt of theſe, the materials whereof it is made, briefly thus. It is the Obedience of Chriſt, as Mediatour, in doing, and ſuffering what God the Father appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which he accepts in the behalf of all thoſe, who are clothed with it; ſo as, upon that account, they are delivered from the ſentence of Eternal Death, which they had righteouſly deſerved; and are accepted as righteous, unto Eternal Life, of which they were utterly unworthy.</p>
            <p>Obſerve then theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God the Father accepts it, as full
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99371:106"/>and perfect ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, for what ever was appointed for them to ſuffer by way of puniſhment, and curſe for ſin. It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. That <hi>Chriſt his own ſelf bare our ſins in his Body, on the Tree. i.e.</hi> The puniſhment and curſe due for ſin. With this God the Father is well pleaſed, ſo that the Sentence of Condemnation ſhall never be executed upon the Soul that is clothed with it. And this he accepteth as a valuable conſideration for all the wrong that their ſins have done him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32,—<hi>forgiving one another, even as God, for Chriſt's ſake, hath forgiven you.</hi> It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. that love to our Brethren <hi>covers a multitude of ſins. i.e.</hi> It doth not ſtrictly take notice of, but in ſilence paſſeth by many failings of others; eſpecially thoſe that concern our ſelves. But this covers All, ſo that no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is taken of them, ſo as (according to the ſentence of the Law) to curſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch a Soul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20, <hi>In thoſe days, and at that time, ſaith the Lord, ſhall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be ſought for, and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they ſhall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi> The book is croſs'd, all the black bill, that otherwiſe would have been brought in againſt it, whereof it could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered one of a thouſand (<hi>i.e.</hi> none at all) is croſſed. Well then might <hi>David</hi> ſay,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99371:106"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whoſe iniquity is covered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God accepts it, in the behalf of all thoſe that are clothed with it, for all that is required by way of perfect obedience to the Moral Law. It is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law, for righteouſneſs.</hi> Chriſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs is the end of the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> the perfection of the Law. Now the end of the Law was, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thoſe that perfectly fulfilled it, with a Righteouſneſs that would give a true right, and title to Eternal Life. But this the Law cannot do, by reaſon of Man's weakneſs, being utterly unable to fulfil it; ſo that it is become a killing Letter, the miniſtration of death, and condemnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. Now Jeſus Chriſt by his obedience, hath brought about this perfection of the Law, perfectly fulfilling the Righteouſneſs, which the Law required; for love is the fulfilling of the Law. Now Jeſus Chriſt loved the Lord with all his heart, and with all his might, and his neighbour as himſelf. He failed not in the leaſt of what was due either to the one, or the other. This he did, and none but he could do it; For though one ſinful act in thought, in word, or deed, did break the Law, yet it is not fulfilled, but by perfect conformity unto it; and ſuch a conformity there was in the obedience of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt Particular. The Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials whereof this garment of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is made; with which, if the Soul be not clothed, it cannot proſper, as we ſhall ſee by and by.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Soul that is not clothed with this Righteouſneſs, cannot, while it remains ſo, poſſibly ever be in a capacity of proſpering. For ſin hath made ſuch a dreadful breach between God and Sinners, that he ſtands upon this: That though he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon whom he will have mercy; the motive is only from the good pleaſure of his own Will. Eternal Life, with all that is antecedent to it, and preparative for it, is his own gift: Yet, I ſay, God is abſolutely reſolved upon this, that he will have his Juſtice ſatisfied for all the wrong that ſin hath done him. He hath alſo magnified his Law, and made it honourable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.21. Therefore he will have all the demands of the Law fully anſwered; and obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto perfectly fulfilled; elſe no ſpiritual good ſhall be given forth to any Soul, ſo as to make it live, much leſs to proſper, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2, <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you, and your God.</hi> Jer. 5.25,—<hi>your ſins have with-holden good things from you.</hi> Now this is done, by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99371:110"/>Therefore, it is of abſolute neceſſity that it be put on, elſe the Soul cannot proſper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Garment of Righteouſneſs is put on, only by a believing Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, <hi>Even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Upon every believing Soul, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the way of God, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners into a ſtate of grace, and mercy; and knowing that God is juſt, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as well as Merciful; knows that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find acceptance with God, but he muſt be righteous, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13, <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Upon every Soul that knows, that every righteouſneſs will not ſerve the turn, but it muſt be ſuch, as the pure eyes of the glorious Majeſty of God can ſee no defect in, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, <hi>That no man is juſtified by the Law, in the ſight of God, it is evident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Upon every Soul that knows and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails the imperfection of his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and knows he hath reaſon to do ſo; though he were ſure he had as much of all the graces that accompany Salvation, as ever <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> had. If this were all, this Soul knows, it would not avail him to ſtand before the Righteous God. No, his infinite wrath would come upon him, for all that, and confume him, <hi>Job</hi> 15.14,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99371:111"/>
               <hi>What is Man, that he ſhould be clean, or he that is born of a Woman, that he ſhould be righteous?</hi> 1 Sam. 6.20. <hi>Who is able to ſtand before this holy Lord God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) A Soul that knows all this in ſome meaſure, and that the Righteouſneſ is ſuch a Righteouſneſs as God will accept of, and ſo adventures his Eternal ſtate upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thereof; reſolving, however Chriſt deal with him, in his ſtrength, to keep faſt his hold there, and to live and dye adhering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and depending upon him. This Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is upon every ſuch a believing Soul. This Faith (though it may be more then a believing Soul knows) hath put on this righteouſneſs, therefore it is called. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9. The ſins of a Believer are put upon Chriſt's account, and Chriſt's righteouſneſs upon his, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Faith being the only grace that receives it, as being peculiarly fitted for it; for no Man was ever accepted as righteous before God for that, which he did himſelf; but by receiving that which Chriſt did for him. And Faith is the only receiving grace. Love lays out, but Faith receives, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, <hi>To as many as received him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The clothing of the Soul with this Righteouſneſs, hath a great influence into Soul proſperity. For conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is that Righteouſneſs alone, that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99371:111"/>anſwers all doubts, and fears, for want of ſuch a righteouſneſs, as might give accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, as to Eternal Life, ſo as to that, how vile ſoever they have judged themſelves, yet being clothed with it, they ſtand without blame before God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22, <hi>In the Body of his fleſh through death, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you holy, and unblameable, and unreprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his ſight.</hi> This alone ſatisfies Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and well it may, for it ſatisfies God himſelf. In this, all the Scripture-Saints, in all Ages, have reſted, being clothed with it. <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> under the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. And <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is that garment alone, in which there may be acceſs with boldneſs, into the preſence of God, even at the laſt day, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.28, <hi>And now, little Children, abide in him, that when he ſhall appear, we may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and not be aſhamed before him, at his coming.</hi> Therefore much more in this day, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12, <hi>In whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs with confidence, by the faith of him.</hi> For this is a Righteouſneſs wherewith (we may warrantably ſay ſo) God is more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed, and which (of the two) finds more acceptance in Heaven, then the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the bleſſed Angels, that never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For their's is but the righteouſneſs of a Creature; This is the Righteouſneſs of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99371:112"/>God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6,—<hi>This is his Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This is <hi>Everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9.24. In this, Chriſt ever hath appeared, and ever will appear in Heaven, in behalf of all thoſe, that come to God by him; and remains ſtill of the ſame Eternal efficacy, for the applying, and forth-giving of all the price of his Blood, all that thereby is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, for the health, well-fare, perfect and Eternal proſperity of the Soul, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>And he is the propitiation for our ſins, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now lay all theſe together, and let them be well weighed, and it will be granted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be found, that when once the Soul comes to have any degree of good hope, through grace, of its intereſt in it, and that it is clothed with it, that Soul will experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally find, that this, above all things elſe, hath a powerful influence into its ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual well-fare, and proſperity. For this keeps life in faith, and heart in hope; and enables the Soul to live in the exerciſe of them both, and in the exerciſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and keeps the heart warm with love to Chriſt. In the exerciſe of which graces (as hath been ſhewed) Soul-proſperity doth conſiſt, and is much promoted, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, <hi>And every one that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf, as he is pure.</hi> Zech. 12.10, <hi>I will
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99371:112"/>powre—the ſpirit of grace, and ſupplication, and they ſhall look on him, whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him.</hi>—Luk. 7.47,—<hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, as ever we deſire that our Souls ſhould proſper, let us be much in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Materials whereof the garment of this Righteouſneſs is made, that we may diſtinctly underſtand it; and let every hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sinner, wreſtling againſt the workings of his unbelief, and making out after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, adventure to apply it, and to receive it, as that which is freely offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17, <hi>And the Spirit, and the Bride ſay, Come: and let him that heareth, ſay, Come. And let him that is athirſt, Come; and whoſoever will, let him take the Water of life freely.</hi> And ſo put it on, though by a weak and trembling faith; and continue ſtill to do it, that ſo in due time, when the only-wiſe God ſees it beſt for us, we may know we have it. This is the way to find reſt to our Souls.</p>
            <p>For conſider but theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That as the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, was the original of all ungodlineſs, and the undoing of all our Souls; ſo the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Righteouſneſs to the Soul, and the clothing of the Soul with it, is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99371:113"/>of all the principles of godlineſs, which are the life, and proſperity of the Soul; for by the merit of his death, Chriſt purchaſed them all; and by his interceſſion, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he applyeth them all.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Conſider this: That it is as great, yea and greater ſatisfaction to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſee an humbled, conflicting Soul receive it, put it on, apply it, and plead it, for what grace and mercy ſoever it ſtands in need of; I ſay it is a greater ſatisfaction to Chriſt himſelf to ſee ſuch a Soul do it, then it is to the Soul it ſelf, that doth it; though he know he hath done it, ſo as is accepted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travail of his Soul, and be ſatisfied.</hi> He accounts all the travails of his Soul, all his ſufferings, all his obedience to the Law ſatisfied for, in this.</p>
            <p>And thus much of that Garment of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is wrought for the Soul, by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Soul that proſpers muſt be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Garment of Righteouſneſs, wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of Chriſt. The righteouſneſs wrought in the Soul, is the ſame with that which is called Saving grace, and true holineſs. It is called <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it is the impreſſion of God's Righteouſneſs upon the Soul, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe whereof, the Soul works unto God, as
<pb facs="tcp:99371:113"/>the chiefeſt good, and utmoſt end, by a right rule ſet in the Word: and therefore often expreſſed by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Every Soul that is clothed with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward garment, the Garment of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought for him; is alſo clothed with the inward Garment of Righteouſneſs wrought in him; though all are not ſo well clothed with it, as ſome are; but in ſome meaſure All are. For theſe two garments though they are diſtinguiſhed, yet they are always worn together, and never divided. Where Chriſt is Righteouſneſs to the Soul, he hath wrought this Righteouſneſs in the Soul. He that puts on Chriſt, puts on <hi>The New Man, which after God, is created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24. Hence it is, that when thoſe, whoſe Souls did proſper, are ſaid to be righteous Perſons, as <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 7.1. <hi>Abel,</hi> Matth. 23.35. <hi>Abraham,</hi> Iſa. 41.2. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luk. 1.6. And <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. his Soul is ſaid to be a righteous Soul. And when it is ſaid, <hi>That the righteous ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the firmament,</hi> Matth. 13.43. And enter <hi>into Eternal Life,</hi> Matth. 25.46. We muſt underſtand it, that they were clothed with both theſe Garments, both that of Righteouſneſs wrought for them, and that of Righteouſneſs wrought in them. And whereas it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, <hi>That no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
<pb facs="tcp:99371:114"/>perſon can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> We muſt underſtand it of thoſe, who have not the double clothing of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: He that hath not both, hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And he that hath the one, hath the other. And ſo far as a Man knows, that he is clothed with the One, ſo far he knows that he is clothed with the Other: and he that queſtions either, will queſtion both. He that is in doubt that he hath not the One, is in doubt that he hath not the Other.</p>
            <p>In the proſecuting of this point, ſomething had need to be ſaid to each of the four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.

                  <item>3. That the better the Soul is clothed with this garment, the more it doth, and the better it will proſper.</item>
                  <item>4. Some Directions in reference to the clothing our ſelves with, and well uſing of this Garment.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What this Garment of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought in us is, or the Materials where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is made. Ye may take this brief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it.</p>
            <pb n="213" facs="tcp:99371:114"/>
            <p>It is that Heaven-born Principle of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, which contains in it, the whole ſeed of God, the univerſal principle of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, enclining the heart ſeriouſly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, that every known truth may be heartily ſubmitted unto; every gracious principle exerciſed, every corruption morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, every duty performed, every infirmity bewailed, the converſation in all things rightly ordered, every Providence impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and all as in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>Ye ſee this garment is made up of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces, I can do no leſs, and I ſhall do more then ſpeak a little to each of them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is that Heaven-born principle of ſpiritual life, which contains in it the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal principle of godlineſs. As Original ſin is a univerſal principle of Corruption, levening throughout the whole lump of Man's nature: So this principle of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wrought in the Soul, graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the whole Man, though not wholly. The new Creature is born at once, though it grows by ſteps and degrees: Therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that thinks, or deſires to be clothed with it, <hi>muſt put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> Eph. 6.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, <hi>Giving all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, add to your faith, vertue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13, <hi>Put on as the elect of God,—bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99371:115"/>long-ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. That's health, when the whole Body thrives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſuch a principle, as inclines the heart ſeriouſly to endeavour to ſubmit to every known truth, though contrary to former apprehenſions, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18, <hi>When they heard theſe things, they held their peace, and glorified God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47,—<hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi> Weigh it well, and I ſuppoſe you will find the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it to be this, why Chriſt ſo highly honours him. <hi>Philip</hi> came and told him, <hi>We have found the Meſſiah. Nathaniel</hi> being poſſeſſed with prejudice, argues againſt it: Can any good thing come out of <hi>Galilee?</hi> Come, and ſee, ſaith <hi>Philip;</hi> and he did ſo. He took the right way to be informed: And notwithſtanding his prejudice, is glad to find out the truth; and accordingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it. That Chriſt indeed was the Meſſiah. This was a Man in whom the Heaven-born principle wrought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its nature, endeavouring to ſubmit to every known truth.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That every grace may be exerciſed in its ſeaſon. Herein, as in all things elſe, it willingly complies with the whole Will of God, which when the principle is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, commands the exerciſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23, <hi>And this is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99371:115"/>and love one another.</hi> It is the exerciſe of faith, and love that is there enjoyned.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Every Corruption mortified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24, <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh, with the affection, and lusts.</hi> They are ſaid, To have done it, becauſe it is part of their every days work.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Duties performed: Of our general Calling, what relates to the worſhip of God, ſo as God may be ſerved acceptably, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28,—<hi>Let us have grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear.</hi> And Duties of our particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that with diligence. The ſame principle that inclines, To be fervent in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (in duties of worſhip) inclines not to be ſlothful in the buſineſs of our Calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. And not only with diligence, as ſome are; They work hard, but do not pray hard. This is not diligence upon principles of Conſcience. But this Heaven-born principle we are ſpeaking of, inclines to diligence, upon a Religious account, that we may abide with God, in our Calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24, <hi>Doing the work thereof heartily, as unto the Lord,</hi> Col. 3.23.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Converſation rightly ordered. When the root of it is in the heart, but the fruits of it are to be expreſſed in our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11, <hi>Being filled with the fruits of Righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:99371:116"/>&amp;c. Thoſe that have this principle within, have this character, That they are upright in their converſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.14,—<hi>to ſlay ſuch as be of upright converſation.</hi> This is that which the Apoſtle means, by walking with a right foot, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. Ordering our ſteps aright, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.26, <hi>Making even paths for our feet,</hi> Heb. 12.13. That is, that one action bear proportion to another, and all good, according to the rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. Not turning aſide to any crooked path. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.4, 5. In order to this, thoſe that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mind their Soul-proſperity will, or ſhould propound to themſelves theſe three queſtions.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>An liceat?</hi> May I do this, and not ſin?</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>An deceat?</hi> Is this becoming a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? May I do this, and not wrong my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion?</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>An Expediat?</hi> May I do this, and not give offence to others?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This Heaven-born principle, let it have its full liberty of working, it will incline the heart to this. And this is the way to order the converſation aright: So as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit that promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.23, <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Providences improved. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.43, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99371:116"/>even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> Puzled, and aſtoniſhed ſuch a Soul may be ſometimes, at the ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God, but not offended, ſo as to face about. Still he holds on his way, in the paths of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9, <hi>The Lord's voice cryeth unto the City; and the Man of wiſdom ſhall ſee thy Name; hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">(8) All this in the ſight of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17, <hi>But as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> That God may be pleaſed, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>And we approve our ſelves to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is impoſſible the Soul ſhould proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or be indeed in any capacity of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that is not clothed with it: For where this Inner is not, the other Outer garment is not. It is ſo, as I told you, that this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Righteouſneſs wrought in us, and that the Righteouſneſs wrought for us, are never ſeparated the one from the other, ſo that the Soul that is altogether deſtitute of it, is in a Chriſtleſs ſtate, naked, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all ſpiritual clothing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. God, at firſt, ſent forth Man into the World compleatly apparelled with it, being created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs: but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, by his ſubtilty, ſtript him of it, and he became naked, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. And thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, till by the powerful Word and Spirit
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99371:117"/>of Chriſt, his heart is made willing to come unto Chriſt, to receive him, reſt upon him, and abide in him. Till then, he is utterly deſtitute of all the materials of this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some indeed, of whom there may be ſome hopes that they have obeyed the Call, and are come to Chriſt, are but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clad, even half naked, which is a ſad ſight. But theſe have none at all, they are naked all over, though inſenſible of it. They have no life at all, nothing of this principle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12, <hi>He that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The better the Soul is clothed with this garment, the more it doth, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it will proſper. For conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The more we have of this Garment of Righteouſneſs, the more the Soul is brought into and preſerved in its right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: The health of the Body conſiſts much in its right conſtitution, when it is not ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with corrupt humours, but that it can reliſh its ordinary food, and can do that work that is to be done, by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein it is ſet, and is not indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by ſickneſs, or weakneſs. Into ſuch a right temper, this righteouſneſs, when the principles of it are exerciſed, doth bring the Soul. This prevails againſt the ill humours the Soul is ſubject unto. It prevails againſt thoſe noiſom luſts that war againſt the Soul, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99371:117"/>
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14. to a Breaſt-plate, which if it be good, preſerves the principal parts of the Body; the Breaſt, wherein the vital parts of Man are cloſely coucht together. So this righteouſneſs preſerves the principal part of a Chriſtian, it keeps the Conſcience pure, the Soul undefiled; ſo far as it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, it will keep a Man from his own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. That which by nature he was more prone unto, then to others.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The more we have of it, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we are clothed with it, the more the Soul will be carried after God. It raiſeth the heart above all worldly enjoyments, ſo that it cannot ſettle upon them, as others do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7, <hi>There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s heart was brought into its right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he could really, and truly, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>th much warmth, and ſtrength of affection, ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth, that I deſire beſides thee,</hi> Pſal. 73.25, 26.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The more we have of it, the more the Soul is fitted for Communion with God. By the firſt principles of it, a man is brought into a ſaving relation to God: but by their exerciſe and increaſe of it, it is fitted for a more ſenſible Communion with God. There muſt be a ſuitableneſs between neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99371:118"/>that enjoy Communion together. Now the more we have of this, the more ſuitableneſs there is in us, to the holy nature of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, <hi>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The more we are clothed with it, the greater worth and excellency is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all natural, and civil righteouſneſs. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action, ſo much as of this principle is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in it, ſo much it turns to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and proſperity of the Soul. Duties of the ſecond Table are turned, as it were, into duties of the firſt, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. To do good, is a duty of the Second Table; and Sacrifice (whileſt it was a part of God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) a duty of the Firſt. But when in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to others, we act upon principles of Religion, and what we do to Man, is out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve to God, and out of reſpect to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us, and to teſtifie our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his goodneſs unto us; it is through Chriſt, acceptable to God, as an act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſo as advantageous to keep the Soul, in a thriving, proſpering frame, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27, <hi>Pure Religion before God and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in their affliction—</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The more we have of it, the better evidence we have for Heaven; True, though we had as much as any Man living, it could
<pb facs="tcp:99371:118"/>not be our Plea for Heaven. The honour of that is reſerved to the righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath wrought for us: But it is our evidence, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith. Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> And when we are under the apprehenſions of death, next unto the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; this will be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt uſe unto us, when all things elſe fail us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3, <hi>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart</hi>—</p>
            <p n="4">4. A few words of the laſt part. Some Directions in reference to the well-clothing of our ſelves with, and well uſing of this garment. Conſider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The deſires of our Souls ſhould be working ſtill after this clothing. There is a bleſſing promiſed to them that hunger, and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Theſe deſires ought to be unlimited. Our deſires ſhould be ſtinted as to what is neceſſary and comely for the clothing of our Bodies, but not ſo, after this clothing for our Souls, we ſhould be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, as the phraſe is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11. This is the moſt genuine property of this principle, To deſire (as we are ſtill under the command) to grow, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2,—<hi>That ye may grow thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Theſe deſires ought to be ruling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.
<pb facs="tcp:99371:119"/>Whatever in the World the Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires with greateſt earneſtneſs, our deſires after this Righteouſneſs muſt rule it. If de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after any thing elſe be prejudicial to theſe deſires, they ought to be mortified, as irregular deſires. Yea a gracious heart will bleſs God, if he croſs them in it, as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily as ever <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord—which hath ſent thee this day to meet me: And bleſſed be thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and bleſſed be thou, which haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed blood</hi>—Still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that reſolution, that we ought not, we cannot, we dare not do any thing againſt this Righteouſneſs; but for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Theſe deſires ought to be conſtant, and not as ſome (as we ſay) when they are in a good mood; but as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20, <hi>My Soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments, at all times.</hi> The righteouſneſs of many is but like the morning dew, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This garment ſhould be put on, and worn every day; otherwiſe, the moths will eat it; the corruption that is in the heart, will ſpoil the beauty, comelineſs, and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Therefore, though it was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in that rich Man to cloth himſelf in Purple and fine Linnen every day; yet it is our duty, that our Souls be clothed every day, with the beſt garments we have, <hi>Luk.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99371:119"/>1.75. That we ſhould ſerve God, <hi>In holineſs and righteouſneſs, all the days of our life:</hi> And then, every day to our dying day; that ſo they may be beſt at laſt: For this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is like the garments of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worſe for wearing; no more is this: For to him that uſeth well that which he hath, more ſhall be given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If at any time there be any rent made in this garment, it muſt be immediately ſtitcht up, and mended, elſe the rent will be made worſe. Thus underſtand me. If there be any rent made in our humility by pride; in our meekneſs by our paſſionate Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; the like may be ſaid of every piece of this garment, of every particular grace; this muſt be made up, by humbling our ſelves before God; applying our ſelves to Chriſt both for pardon, and more ſupplies from his fullneſs. So <hi>David,</hi> when his faith failed in the exerciſe, as he confeſſeth, <hi>Pſal</hi> 73.2, <hi>My feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt.</hi> He had loſt his ſtanding by faith, and judged by ſenſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. For this, (immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the diſcovery) he humbles himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.22, <hi>Thus my heart was grieved— ſo fooliſh was I</hi>—And this made up the rent, and then his heart was carried out, as ſtrongly after God, as ever, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.26, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99371:120"/>
            <p n="4">4. By way of encouragement, To get all we can, and to preſerve all we get, and to make the beſt uſe of it, every day, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Though this garment be not ſuch a covering, as that garment of righteouſneſs, which Chriſt hath wrought for us, for that covers from the guilt of ſin, yet this is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering garment too.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) From that diſ-reſpect, which mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Birth, or breeding, which deformity of Body, or a poor, and low condition in the World, may, and often doth, expoſe a Man unto, eſpecially with thoſe that value Men by the outſide. See what a covering this is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26, <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his neighbour.</hi> Heb. 11.38, <hi>Of whom the World was not worthy;</hi> though they were worth little, or nothing in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Though this garment covers not the guilt of ſin before God, yet it covers the nakedneſs cauſed by ſin, before Men. Sin makes a Man naked to his ſhame, in the eyes of Men: as <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.25, <hi>And when</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaw the people that they were naked (for</hi> Aaron <hi>had made them naked unto their ſhame, before their Enemies.</hi>) As whatever deformity there is in a Man's Body is ſeen by thoſe that ſee him naked. This garment when it is worn, as it ought to be every
<pb facs="tcp:99371:120"/>day, covers this nakedneſs. As Humility covers the nakedneſs of Pride; Meekneſs, the nakedneſs of raſh, and unadviſed Anger, ſtirred up, either without cauſe, or when there is cauſe, without meaſure. Sobriety, the nakedneſs of Intemperance; A free, and liberal diſpoſition, the nakedneſs of Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, and Covetouſneſs. Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial the nakedneſs, of Self ſeeking, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15, <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his garments, leſt he walk naked, and Men ſee his ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) In ſome ſenſe, it covers the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cauſed by ſin, from the eyes of God; ſo far, that though he hates the ſin, and often corrects ſeverely for it, yet when he ſees this garment, he is not extreme to mark againſt ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3, <hi>The moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul ſins in many things.</hi> Yet, <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. It is this righteous Soul, clothed with the garment of this Righteouſneſs wrought in us, over which Chriſt will caſt the Garment of that Righteouſneſs, which he hath wrought for the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man, to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.</hi> But, who is this Man? The next words tell us, <hi>In whoſe ſpirit there is no guile. i. e.</hi> That hath this righteouſneſs, which Chriſt works in the Soul. Therefore as we deſire, that our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99371:121"/>Souls ſhould proſper, let us gird this gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cloſe about us; and follow after this righteouſneſs while we live, and we ſhall be able to lay hold upon Eternal Life, when we dye, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11, 12. And then Soul-proſperity will be perfected.</p>

THere is yet one thing more for the preſervation of Bodily health; eſpecially for thoſe that lead a ſedentary life, and that is moderate exerciſe, for the motion, and ſtirring of the body. For thereby Natural heat is ſtirred up, and increaſed: Ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours abounding, are leſſened, and ſpent: Concoction, and diſtribution of meats far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.

            <p>Anſwerable to this, there is an exerciſe, which is exceeding profitable, and every way much more neceſſary for the well-fare, and proſperity of the Soul. It is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of godlineſs, that is good for all things: upon that account, the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> unto it, whoſe Soul he deſired might proſper, even as his own, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7,—<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thy ſelf rather unto godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have, ſeveral times, touched on this point, already, ſince this ſubject was entred upon, and ſomewhat largely, in the third
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99371:122"/>Diſcourſe upon it. And very often hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as there hath been occaſion) for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years by-paſt, as poſſibly, ſome have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of. And to uſe the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance of it: For this, in a manner, is all in all, for the well-fare, and proſperity of your Souls: which I ſhould rejoyce to be, in the leaſt, inſtrumental, to promote, among you. I think I may ſay it (and ſay it truly) that if any thing, at any time, ſaddens my thoughts of death, which my age, and many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities give me warning of, and command me to prepare for; this is like to be it, To think that I leave no more of you (for ought can be diſcerned) to be ſpiritually alive; and therefore in no preſent capacity to be proſpering in your Souls. And of thoſe that are (as it may be hoped) ſpiritually alive, they are ſo few, that mind this, as the one thing neceſſary, that the principle of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life in them, might be lively, active, and vigorous, that ſo their Souls might proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, one day after another, one day as well as another, and moſt of all at laſt. Ye may think of this, when I am with you no more. Ye will pardon this ſhort digreſſion, and not take that with the Left Hand, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with the Right;</p>

            <p>But to ſpeak to that, which is now to be ſpoken to, I mean, The exerciſe of godlineſs; which (as I ſaid) will be really found to be all in all, for the promoting of Soul-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Though ſomething hath been ſaid to it, ſince I entred upon this Text: yet the fuller handling of it, I reſerved on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe till now, conceiving it would moſt properly fall under this head.</p>
            <p>The Particulars to be ſpoken to are theſe.
<list>
                  <item>1. What the exerciſe of godlineſs is, and wherein it doth conſiſt.</item>
                  <item>2. Wherein it ought to be exerciſed.</item>
                  <item>3. Wherefore we ought to be ſo much in the exerciſe of it, if we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper.</item>
                  <item>4. Then a few things by way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to quicken us, to be up, and doing in this matter, as we deſire the Lord ſhould be with our Souls, either while we live, or when we dye.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe. What it is.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> It is the ſetting of every principle of godlineſs about, and keeping it cloſe unto its proper work, that ſo it may bring forth its proper and peculiar fruit in the ſeaſon thereof. As it is ſaid of every Man, that God appoints him his proper work, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.34. So he hath for every principle of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and the higheſt acting thereof, is the perfect work of that grace.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:99371:123"/>
            <p>I ſhall give you ſome inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Patience, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4, <hi>Let patience have its perfect work.</hi> The proper work of that grace, is quietly, willingly, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to ſubmit to the holy, and righteous will of God, in all afflicting Providences. Where, and when there are no tryals, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſuffered, nothing to be endured, there is no work for patience: As there was none in the ſtate of Innocency, and will be none in the ſtate of Glory. But in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, God hath ſeveral ways to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and ſeveral ways doth exerciſe this grace in his people; ſo as there are few or none, but fall into divers tryals, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as is more then intimated, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3. As that poor youth in the Goſpel, fell ſometimes into the fire, and ſometimes into the water. So God changeth his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The tryal is ſometimes in this, and ſometimes in that. Now, I ſay, the proper work of Patience under them all, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoever they be, of what kind ſoever they be, how near ſoever they come, how deep ſoever they cut, and how long ſoever they continue, is to keep ſilence before the Lord, to ſanctifie his name in all, as holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, faithful and gratious; believingly waiting for a bleſſed iſſue to all. This is the proper work of patience, and in doing this conſiſts the exerciſe of patience as we
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99371:123"/>ſee it exemplified in <hi>Job</hi> cap. 1, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Faith hath its peculiar work, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11, <hi>The work of faith, with power.</hi> And the proper work of faith, is to receive Jeſus Chriſt, and reſt upon him, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for a full diſcharge from the guilt of every ſin,, and for acceptance with God as righteous, unto Eternal Life: And to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt daily, for ſupplies of grace, for ſtrength againſt temptations from the World, the Fleſh, or the Devil; and for ability to perform what is daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, in thoſe relations wherein we ſtand, and in that condition, wherein we are, ſo as we may be enabled to hold on cheerfully, and comfortably in the race that is ſet before us, notwithſtanding all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, we meet with in our way: Thus it was Prophetically promiſed of, and to the believing Jews, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith;</hi> and to all believers to the end of the World: Still keeping heart in their hopes, for the accompliſhment of whatever God hath promiſed; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the real improbabilities, and ſeeming impoſſibilities, that be in the way. This is the proper work of faith, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, conſiſts, the exerciſe of faith. Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.19, 20. <hi>For we walk by faith, not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. We do not enjoy all that is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99371:124"/>but in the exerciſe of faith, we wait for it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Repentance hath its proper work too; which is to bring forth fruits meet for Repentance, ſuitable to the nature of ſuch a gracious principle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8. Such as heart-humbling, and afflicting the Soul with godly ſorrow, for ſin; joined with the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart againſt every known ſin, ſo as we may attain to the ſenſe of God's reconciliation with us, and keep our hearts in a reconciled frame toward his holy Will in all things. This is proper work for this grace, and in doing hereof, conſiſts the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Repentance. See this exemplified, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19,—<hi>turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after I was turned, I repented,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Self-denyal hath its proper work. To deny ſelf-will, ſelf-ends, ſelf-intereſt in all worldly concernments whatſoever, and how far ſoever they ſtand in opoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or in competition with, the command, intereſt, and glory of Jeſus Chriſt. And are inconſiſtent with the Conſcience of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which we owe unto his Majeſty. This is the work which God hath appointed unto this grace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23, <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi> And in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this work, this grace is exerciſed. See
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99371:124"/>it exemplified in <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.24, <hi>By faith</hi> Moſes, <hi>when he came to years, refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The grace of Fear, hath its proper work, to keep the heart in an holy awe of God, ſenſible of his all-ſeeing eye upon us, regulating all our thoughts, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as becomes the preſence of ſo holy a God. This is the proper work for the fear of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.13, <hi>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.</hi> And in doing of this work, conſiſts the exerciſe of this grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1, —<hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh, and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God. i.e.</hi> In the exerciſe of this grace. See this exemplified in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.9, <hi>How can I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God.</hi> And in <hi>Nehemiah, chap.</hi> 5.15, <hi>But, ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) The grace of Meekneſs hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work: And that is in the juſt modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the paſſion of anger; preventing, or quickly cooling, and ſubduing, all undue heats; ſo as this unruly paſſion may never be moved without cauſe, or when there is cauſe, not without meaſure, to walk in the exerciſe of this grace. And becauſe there are ſo few examples of it among the proud, froward, unbroken-hearted generation of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99371:125"/>Men, we are called upon to learn it of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly of heart.</hi> This being ſuch a grace, as no Chriſtian, without the exerciſe of it, can poſſibly walk worthy of his Calling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2, <hi>I—beſeech you, walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and meekneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) The grace of Charity hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work: Ye have it deſcribed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6, 7. In doing this work, the grace of Charity is exerciſed, and the command of Chriſt ſo far fulfilled, who commands us, <hi>To walk in love,</hi> Eph. 5.2. And requires it of us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14, That <hi>all our things be done in charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe few inſtances ſhew, what it is to live in the exerciſe of godlineſs. Ye ſee, here are gracious principles in the heart, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious actings, ſuitable thereunto, and iſſuing from them. And theſe are the things wherein the proſperity of the Soul conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wherein ought we to exerciſe our ſelves unto godlineſs?</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> In every thing we do: Whether we eat, or drink, or whatever we do, we ought to do all to the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Though we are neceſſitated often to change our Actions, yet we ought never to change our End. This muſt be always the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99371:125"/>and moſt ſupreme End. And this can never be done, but in the exerciſe of the principles of godlineſs. It cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that I ſhould inſtance in every thing. I ſhall inſtance in thoſe things that may be moſt comprehenſive. Conſider then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe principles ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in thoſe ſpiritual outgoings, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actings of the inward Man, which are immediately acted upon God, and raiſe the heart Heaven-ward; though not drawn forth in acts of inſtituted worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As they are drawn forth, exerciſed, and, as it were, clothed with the external duties of Religion; or any thing elſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the viſible part of Religion (as far as it may be viſible to Man) doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the former. In the ſpiritual out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings, and holy actings of the inward Man. So as to do ſomething toward the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that great duty injoined, both in the Old Teſtament, and in the New. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13, <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15, <hi>But ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts.</hi> But how is this? That God, who is the God of all grace, ſhould ſanctifie all thoſe whom he ſets apart for himſelf. And that he ſhould ſanctifie his own name, in vindicating it, from thoſe low, and unworthy thoughts that Men have of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99371:126"/>him: This is ſomewhat eaſie to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: But how ſhall a poor Creature loaden with many infirmities do it? For the preſent, I cannot think of any better way then this, even in the ſpiritual out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and actings of the principle of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, immediately upon God himſelf, ſo as to compoſe our affections, thoughts, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, deſires, reſolutions, and all the inward workings of our hearts in a ſuitable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe glorious diſcoveries, that God hath made of his name, as infinitely holy, wiſe, juſt and gracious, preſent every where, ſeeing all things, obſerving all things, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things according to the counſel of his own will. The inſtance, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives, makes for this: For when he had called them to their duty, To ſanctifie God in their hearts, he directs them how to do it. <hi>[Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.]</hi> Thus the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſanctified God's Name, in his heart, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all his hopes, and all his comforts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God alone, reſolving to rejoice in him, when he had nothing elſe to rejoice in, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4, <hi>Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I ſay, Rejoice.</hi> This is that which is required in the firſt, and great Commandment; wherein indeed (if we conſider it well) we ſhall find all the other Commands wrapt up; for always
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99371:126"/>before we do any thing amiſs againſt God, we either think amiſs of God, or think not of him at all. Therefore as ever we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, let us be careful, at all times, in all places, thus to ſanctifie God's Name in our hearts. And whatever our condition be, how ſad ſoever it be with us, ſtill both think well, and ſpeak well of God, as ſuch a God ought to be ſpoken of, and thought of. Satan hath baffled many eminent Perſons, when they have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tryal, with temptations contrary to this. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in his diſtreſs, lets fall ſuch ſad words as theſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.18, <hi>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuſeth to be healed? Wilt thou be altogether unto me, as a lyar, and as waters that fail?</hi> And <hi>David</hi> being (as we ſay) under hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſaid in his haſte, (though upon ſecond thoughts, he call'd in his words again) that he had ſerved a hard Maſter, and that all his exerciſing himſelf unto godlineſs, had been in vain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13.14. It concerns us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (as we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper) ſo to exerciſe the principles of godlineſs, we have received, that even when the dealings of God with us, are moſt contrary to our deſires, and hopes, to think of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that repreſentation which he makes of himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. We
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99371:127"/>may obſerve, that <hi>David,</hi> (when he acted like a Man after God's own heart) did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68, <hi>Thou art good, and doeſt good:</hi> Yet how it was with him, in his outward condition, we ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 61. <hi>The bands of the wicked have robbed me:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>My Soul melteth for heavineſs.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had expreſſed his ſad condition, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10, <hi>I am in trouble; mine eye is conſumed with grief: My life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighing:</hi> Yet he breaks out into admiration; <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, <hi>O, how great is thy goodneſs, which thou haſt laid up for them, that fear thee?</hi> And yet he ſaw but little of it laid out upon him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.1,—<hi>the goodneſs of God endureth continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt way propoſed, wherein we ought to exerciſe our ſelves unto godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed to the ſecond thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. How theſe principles of godlineſs ought to be exerciſed, as they are to be drawn forth, and clothed, as it were, with the External duties of Religion, or any thing elſe wherein the viſible part of Religion (ſo far as it may be made viſible to Men) doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>And here note two things, as to External duties of Religion.
<list>
                  <item>1. That we ought to exerciſe our ſelves in them all.</item>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:99371:127"/>
                  <item>2. That theſe principles of godlineſs ought to be exerciſed in them all.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the former. Thoſe that really mind, as we all ought to mind the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Souls muſt compaſs them all, and take them all in, in their walk, though not all at once, nor all, it may be, every day, but all in their Seaſon. It is a dangerous, yea a deſperate thing, To perform one duty, that we may diſpence with our ſelves in the neglect of another. As to perform duties in conjunction with others; and give our ſelves, on that account, a diſpenſation to neglect perſonal, and private duties. It is our duty (as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21.) to do all things without partiality; eſpecially all things in Religion. This I deſire may be conſidered. There is no Duty or Ordinance of Gods own appointment, which he hath not bleſſed at one time, or other; to ſome one or other, of his People; ſo as ſometimes they have found him in one, when they have not found him in another. As for inſtance, God hath been found in Prayer, private Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6, <hi>This poor man cried unto the Lord, and he ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi> In praying with others, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.31, <hi>And when they had prayed, the place was ſhaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In private reading of the word, as the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.27, 28. In hearing the word, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99371:128"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. While the two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that went to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Chriſt, Chriſt himſelf drew near to them, and went with them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.15. <hi>And their hearts burned within them, while he talked with them by the way, and opened the Scriptures to them,</hi> verſ. 32. So in ſinging, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.22, <hi>And when they began to ſing, the Lord ſet ambuſhments againſt the children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, He cut them off ſuddenly, as when Men are cut off by their enemies that lye in ambuſh againſt them; and ſo accompliſhed what was foretold, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, <hi>Ye ſhall not need to fight in this battel, ſtand still, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord.</hi> Memorable is that ſtory of the Proteſtants of <hi>Mountaban</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who, when they were beſieged (being compelled to take up Arms in their own defence) always when they went out to fight, went out ſinging of Pſalms, which was ſo terrible to the Enemy, that, in the end, when they heard them ſinging, which they uſually began, before the Portcullis was drawn up, and the Gates opened, their hearts failed them, and away they would run, crying out, <hi>They come, they come.</hi> And as this is true, that there is no duty, but that at ſome time, or other, God hath been found in it, by ſome or other; ſo they have ſometimes found him in one, when they could not find him in another.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99371:128"/>
               <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 4, <hi>She ſought him</hi> in private duties, and <hi>found him not;</hi> then ſhe went to the publick, and <hi>found him whom her Soul loved. Daniel</hi> was, certainly, a Man of much prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. and no doubt found very frequently, ſenſible accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God; but yet it ſeems God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the fulleſt manifeſtation of his love to him, till, to his daily prayer, he added extraordinary prayer, with faſting. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. And it was ſo with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as ye may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.39.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the encouragement is great to take up every duty in its Seaſon. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us, that the efficacy of co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate means is in conjunction. As for the preſervation of bodily health, there muſt be both Food, and Raiment, and Reſt, and the uſe of Phyſick ſometimes, as the matter requireth; no one of theſe is ſufficient. So it is here. Let none think, his Soul will proſper, though he uſe this, or that Duty; if any one known to be a Duty, be willingly neglected in the ſeaſon thereof. It is the policy of Satan to ſeparate one duty from another, that ſo we may not be uniform in our endeavours. Few are ſo bad, as to uſe no means at all, and few are ſo faithful to God, and their own Souls, as conſcienciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to uſe All. This half-doing, proves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:99371:129"/>a Souls undoing. Therefore as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that our Souls ſhould proſper, we ſhould, as <hi>Caleb,</hi> follow fully after God. And in all, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8, <hi>Follow hard after God.</hi> As thriving Children do ſuck, and draw hard ſometimes at one Breaſt, and ſometimes at another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we ought to exerciſe our ſelves in them all; ſo we ought to exerciſe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of godlineſs in them all. A few words to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In general thus. The principles of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ought to be exerciſed in them all, ſo far as God's gracious ends, and purpoſes in, and by them (ſo far as they are revealed to us) may be anſwered, and attained. I ſhall inſtance in theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This God hath revealed as one great end to be carried on, in and by them all, that this holy and bleſſed name may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in them all, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. This is done, when the inward frame of our hearts is ſuch, when we addreſs our ſelves unto God, as that God himſelf may thereby ſee that we believe him to be a great God, a gracious God, a God in all reſpects infinitely glorious. This is due unto him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.7, <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Saints: and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</hi> And this <hi>David</hi> reſolves upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.7, <hi>But as for me, I will come into thy
<pb facs="tcp:99371:129"/>houſe, in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear, will I worſhip toward thy holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> So far as our hearts attain this temper, ſo far we anſwer God's end. This is to ſerve him acceptably, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This likewiſe God hath revealed as his intent, and purpoſe, that thereby he may communicate unto the people of his choice, thoſe ſpiritual gifts and graces, whereby they may be enabled, to that work he hath appointed them, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that happineſs, he hath promiſed them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24, <hi>In all places where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſs thee.</hi> Pſal. 133.3. For there the Lord commanded the bleſſing, and life for ever-more. The attainment of this end ſhould be ſo deeply engraven upon our hearts, that as the Bee moves from one flower to another, to gather materials for Honey: So ſhould we from one Duty to another, for ſupplies of grace, ſuitable to our preſent neceſſities. This was <hi>David</hi>'s end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3, <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee,</hi> &amp;c. For this end, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of godlineſs ſhould be exerciſed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fore-mentioned end: And if ſo, we are ſo much the more likely to attain this end, the more grace we bring in exerciſe to a duty, the more grace we are like to receive in, and by that duty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto
<pb facs="tcp:99371:130"/>every one that hath, ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance.</hi> Thus, in general.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, principles of grace ſhould be exerciſed in all the fore-mentioned duties. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in one, and that is the duty of Prayer; both becauſe that is, and ought to be our every days work: We ought in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, both great and ſmall, to make known our requeſts to God, believing his univerſal Providence; that as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo great that is above his Power, ſo there is nothing ſo little that is below his Care. This we are injoined, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, <hi>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing, by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſgiving; let your requeſts be made known unto God.</hi> And alſo, becauſe the better this duty is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the better all other duties will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: It hath an influence upon them all, and is often put for the whole worſhip of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12, 13, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And beſides, all the Providences of the day are ſanctified by it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5, <hi>For it is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the word of God, and Prayer.</hi> But then we muſt know this, that if we deſire prayer may be a ſanctifying duty to us, our hearts muſt be ſanctified for it, and grace muſt be exerciſed in it. I ſhall not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now, what graces muſt be exerciſed, but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99371:130"/>only in general, ſo that the heart may be wrought off from all evil frames, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and fixed, the inward thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of gathered in, and the affections raiſed, ſo as feelingly, and awfully, believingly, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently and ſincerely we may powre out our deſires unto God, and be able to ſay, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.18, <hi>Their heart cryed unto the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.145, <hi>I cryed with my whole heart, hear me, O Lord.</hi> This is one thing intended in that expreſſion of Praying in the ſpirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. The ſpirit of a Man is an active thing, and whatever it doth, good, or bad, it doth to purpoſe. Such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious workings of the Soul in prayer, are the very Soul of prayer; and then the Soul proſpers by prayer, <hi>Jude, verſ.</hi> 20, <hi>And ye, Beloved, building up your Souls in your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Then are our Souls edified, when we thus pray, in the exerciſe of the graces of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This is all I ſhall ſay to the former of the two laſt things propoſed. That in order to Soul-proſperity, grace ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, in all the External Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the latter. As ever we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of godlineſs ought to be exerciſed in all other things, wherein the viſible part of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99371:131"/>Religion, ſo far as it may be made viſible to Men, doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall only ſpeak a little to three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In all Providences. It is ſeldom or never ſeen, that any of the people of God continue in the ſame condition, as to the things of this World, any long time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome alteration, more or leſs. God is pleaſed, many times, to beſtow many good things upon them, which he never intended they ſhould always enjoy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.10,— <hi>Thou haſt lifted me up, and caſt me down.</hi> Now, as we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, principles of godlineſs ſhould be ſo exerciſed, as to bear all ſuch changes, ſo as to avoid the ſnares, and temptations accompanying them. To this height St. <hi>Paul</hi> attained, that he could thus manage all conditions, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12, <hi>I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound,</hi> &amp;c. Want, or no want; having nothing, or poſſeſſing all things, make no change of the frame of my heart. So he ſaith, <hi>I am inſtructed in every thing.</hi> This is the excellency of the principles of godlineſs, That though truths, and falſhood; things morally good, or morally evil, are at ſuch a diſtance, that the ſame principles cannot turn to either ſide: yet Poverty and Riches, a full Eſtate, and a poor and mean Eſtate, liberty or reſtraint are not at ſuch
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99371:131"/>a diſtance, but that the ſame gracious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple can apply it ſelf to both the one, and the other; and may be exerciſed ſo as the Soul may proſper, and may be ſpiritually a gainer, both by the one, and by the other. And as we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, theſe principles ought to be exerciſed, that we may find it ſo. For ſo far as corruption mingles with the Providences we are under, ſo far, if there be any grace in the heart, it will be ſo far from thriving, that it will wither, and decay. It is obſerved, that when things go well with a Man in his outward condition, if corruption be not kept at a diſtance from it, the Man will grow proud, and paſſionate; high, and ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited: Earthy, and Selfiſh, impatient of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſſed in any thing; having, as he finds, wit enough for every thing elſe, and that therefore every one muſt ſtoop to him. And ſo, when things go croſs, and, as the uſual phraſe is, <hi>The World frowns upon him;</hi> if his corruptions be not kept at a diſtance from his condition, the Man will grow fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, diſcontented, unthankful for what he hath, envious at thoſe, with whom it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then with himſelf: And (to ſpeak all in a word) ſin will ſit light, when croſſes fit heavy. Therefore, it is of abſolute neceſſity, that, as ever we deſire our Souls ſhould proſper, this (with the uttermoſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99371:132"/>of our care) ſhould be looked unto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when the good hand of God is for us, ſo as all our Goings out, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings-in, the beginning and ending of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing we undertake, ſucceeds well, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our deſires, that then theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of grace ought to be exerciſed, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing come betwixt Jeſus Chriſt, and our hearts, but that the more we have of the World, the more our hearts may be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As <hi>Jacob</hi> was then deſirous to be in Heaven, when God had given in the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſight of his loſt Son, his beſt Son, and that as great as he was good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.30, <hi>And</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Joſeph, <hi>Now let me dye, ſince I have ſeen thy face.</hi> Jam. 1.10, <hi>Let the rich Man rejoice in that he is made low, becauſe as the flower of the graſs he ſhall paſs away. [when he is made low.] i. e.</hi> When his heart is low and meek, humble and patient, when his condition is full, and high; though perhaps not ſo in it ſelf, but as compared with others, who had the ſame opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the World, that he had; reckoning of all that he hath, but as food that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but as a flower that fadeth: account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this as the chiefeſt excellency of the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs of his Eſtate, that he hath a larger opportunity of doing good; and of doing more for God, then he could have had, if his portion had been as little, as once it was.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99371:132"/>Thus to exerciſe grace, To bear ſuch full a cup without ſpilling, argues not only the truth, but alſo the ſtrength of grace; and is the way to make the Soul proſper, as faſt as the Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In all our civil converſe with Men, principles of godlineſs muſt be exerciſed, with righteouſneſs, and ſobriety, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12, <hi>Yea with all courteſie, and kindneſs.</hi> 3 Epiſt. of <hi>John, v.</hi> 6. <hi>Gaius</hi> is exhorted, in his kindneſs to the Brethren, that travelled up and down, about the affairs of the Goſpel, when he brought them onwards on their Journey, to do it after a godly ſort. That which the Apoſtle preſſeth on aged Women is the duty of all, both old, and young, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2, <hi>That the aged women be ſober, grave, temperate.</hi> Zech. 14.20, 21, <hi>In that day ſhall be written upon the Bells of the horſes, Holineſs to the Lord: And every Pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be holineſs to the Lord.</hi> This was written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the High-Prieſts Mitre, as he was a type of the great High-Prieſt, the Lord Jeſus, who was holy, and undefiled. That which Men are thereby taught is this, That the meaneſt things of common uſe, ſhould be holily uſed: In all we do, we ſhould act as perſons conſecrated to God; that are not our own, and therefore we ought to glorifie God, with our Bodies, and with our Spirits, which are God's, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. Even in our
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99371:133"/>natural actions, <hi>Whether we eat, or drink, or whatever we do, we ſhould do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Now I have told you already (and I told you the truth) that God is not glorified (it will appear ſo one day) but when the principles of godlineſs are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. Neglect hereof, even in theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions, is charged upon Men, as their ſin. <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 12. That they did feed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all companys: So as where ever we are, we always keep our hearts under the awe of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29, <hi>Let no corrupt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication proceed out of your mouth.</hi> Col. 4.6, <hi>Let your ſpeech be always with grace, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Salt.</hi> But of this, more under another head, in the next uſe of this Point.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="11" type="sermon">
            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:99371:133"/>
            <head>SERMON XI.</head>
            <p>I Come now to the third Particular; The reaſons why theſe principles of godlineſs ought to be ſtirred up: So as to be ſet about, and kept cloſe to their proper work; that they may bring forth their proper, and peculiar fruit, in due ſeaſon, and that in order to Soul-proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is that which ſpecially falls under the authority of Command. Obſerve it, and you will find, that when the Scripture ſpeaks to profeſſing Chriſtians, the principles are ſuppoſed to be infuſed; and the exerciſe is ſpecially required, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24, <hi>Put on the new Man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Not by Converſion, that is ſuppoſed; for he owns them as faithful Brethren in Chriſt, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. But put them on, for operation, for exerciſe. The new Creature, the firſt day of its birth, is a new Man: It is born at once, though it grows up by degrees; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular principle of godlineſs is a member of this new Man. Put them on ſo, as ye may have them ready, and nothing may
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99371:134"/>be wanting, when Providence calls for their exerciſe; ſo that <hi>Your loins be girded about, and your lights burning,</hi> Luk. 12.35. Thus alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God.</hi> Be ready furniſhed to break through whatever ſnares, and temptations ye may meet withal, in running that race, which God hath ſet before you. Several inſtances were given, wherein this is required of us, in the third exerciſe upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are given for this very end, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that inference is rational, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit.</hi> Theſe ſpiritual principles are that ſpiritual ſtock, which God hath given us, to drive on our ſpiritual trade withal, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, which cannot be attained, unleſs they be exerciſed. As unleſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon be exerciſed, which are for making human ſociety uſeful, there can be no dealing, nor profitable converſe between Man, and Man. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.14. What ſhall I do with a Mad-man, ſaid <hi>Achiſh,</hi> for ſo <hi>David</hi> feigned himſelf to be; and therefore he drave him away. This ſhould be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered of, for theſe two things we find.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That for neglect of this, in not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering God's end herein, that thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:99371:134"/>have lived moſt highly in the favour of God, have met with many a bruſh from the hand of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.20, <hi>Thou ſhalt be dumb, and not able to ſpeak—becauſe thou believeſt not my words, which ſhall be fulfilled in their ſeaſon.</hi> Num. 20.12, <hi>Becauſe ye believed not me, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>therefore ye ſhall not bring this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation into the Land, which I have given them.</hi> It was not for want of faith, either in the one, or in the other, that the hand of God was ſo heavy upon them, but for want of the exerciſe of faith.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This we find, That though it be true, God will reward every good Man, for every good work: And he hath a Book of Remebrance, for that purpoſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. Yet this is true, That how good ſoever, a Mans actions be, in their own nature, and for the kind of them, there is no reward to be expected from God, farther then grace is exerciſed in them. Alms-giving, Prayer, and Faſtings are good works, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, but if theſe principles of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be not well exerciſed in them, ſee what becomes of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.2, 5. And on the contrary, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give to drink, unto one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a Diſciple; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward,</hi> Matth. 10.42. This ſhould have
<pb facs="tcp:99371:135"/>ſome weight with us, that God will call us to account, what ſpiritual Trade we have driven with our ſpiritual ſtock, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The neglect of this exerciſe is that which Satan watcheth for, and will be ſure to improve to his advantage, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25, <hi>While Men ſlept, his enemy came, and ſowed tares among the wheat.</hi> It ſeems he knows our ſlumbering fits, yea without doubt he doth: for he knows not only what orders Men obſerve in their walks abroad, what company they keep, what diſcourſe they have with them, and how they ſpend their time, but alſo, much of what they do within doors: For though he have not a key to the heart (that is God's prerogative) yet he ſtands, as it were, in the Room by. Though he knows not our thoughts, yet when they are clothed with words, as when we are at Prayer, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our Petitions, and Confeſſions; and can make a ſhrewd gueſs thereby, what the frame and temper of our hearts are. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that he may know as much by us, as any Man may do, and more too. Now <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.5, <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the heart of man is a great deep. i. e.</hi> The thoughts, deſigns, intentions, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of Men are a great deep, like deep waters, where it is a great way to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
<pb facs="tcp:99371:135"/>a Man cannot eaſily dive into them, to find out what they are; but an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Man, by prudent and conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them; of what they do, and what company they keep, of the words that fall from them, and of their looks, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, may give (and ſometimes have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a conjecture not much amiſs of them. And if ſo; then Satan much more, who goes about continually, ſtudying always as he goes, obſerving, and diligently conſidering Mens temper, and diſpoſitions, Mens calling and conditions; and as he finds things, ſo he caſts about what is fit to be done to ſuch or ſuch a Perſon; how to fit the Key for the Lock, and which way he may aſſault him ſo, as his temptation may take; and where he may have moſt advantage againſt him. And this he knows, that ſo far as he can diſcern that ſpiritual ſlothfulneſs creeps upon a Man, and that the exerciſe of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is neglected, ſo far the day is his own. He knows there is nothing but this armour of God, whereby he can be reſiſted; and this too as put on, and kept in exerciſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13. Upon this account, unleſs we are willing to betray our Souls unto him, that was a murderer from the beginning; we ought to be conſtant in this duty, and put on this armour of God, both on the right hand, and on the left, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99371:136"/>
            <p n="4">4. It is in the exerciſe of theſe principles, each of them, in their ſeaſon, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, ſupporting, comforting preſence of God, may (upon Scripture-grounds) be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and enjoyed in every condition, ſo as our Souls may proſper in it, and by it, whatever it be. We read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. That the Lord exerciſeth Loving-kindneſs, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, and that, in theſe things he delighteth. Now thoſe whoſe hearts are moſt buſied in this exerciſe, have the cleareſt grounds from the word, that he will exerciſe them in their behalf, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9, <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to, and fro, through the whole Earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them, whoſe heart is perfect toward him.</hi> His Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial eye is over them, <hi>Job</hi> 36.7, <hi>He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth not his eyes from the righteous.</hi> He looks to them by night, and by day, that no evil touch them, <hi>Job</hi> 5.19, <hi>He ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee in ſix troubles; yea in ſeven ſhall no evil touch thee. i.e.</hi> So as to hurt thee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. i.e.</hi> In their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtate, and what concerns, the well-fare of their Souls. That's ſecured to them that live in the exerciſe of the love of God. That's the good that Text ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, <hi>All things ſhall work together for good, to them that love God.</hi> The good whereby
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:99371:136"/>their Soul proſpers. But let a Man through the prevalency of his corruptions, diſuſe himſelf from this exerciſe, and ſuffer theſe principles of godlineſs to lye, as it were, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden, choaked, and oppreſſed by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ungodlineſs, and his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (if it be awake) will give check to his hopes, if he expect that God ſhould favour him with ſucceſs, either in his goings out, or comings in, the beginning or ending of any thing he takes in hand: God may do it, and often doth it; but it is more then any ſuch perſon hath ground to expect, or can expect, with any good hope to ſpeed, or plead with God for. It is obſervable, what we have in the fore-mentioned place, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16.9. in the latter part of the verſe. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> ſaith the Prophet to the King (to King <hi>Aſa</hi> it is that he ſpeaks) <hi>thou haſt done fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly: Henceforth, thou ſhalt have wars.</hi> Now wherein was it, that he had done fooliſhly? See <hi>ver.</hi> 7. It was in this, that he had not exerciſed his faith, that great principle of godlineſs, in relying upon the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but had relyed upon the King of <hi>Syria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. There is no way like this, for the growth and exerciſe of theſe principles, wherein, as I told you in the explication of the point, the proſperity of the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth eſpecially: It is well known, they do not always prove the richeſt Men, that ſet
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99371:137"/>up with the greateſt ſtocks, but thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> exerciſe themſelves with diligence, honeſty, and integrity in their Callings, though they begin with little. And likewiſe, The beſt Wits do not always prove the beſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, unleſs their ſtudy be anſwerable to their parts. It is even ſo in this caſe: For certain it is, that leſs degrees of grace, well managed in daily exerciſe, will thrive and grow, when greater meaſures neglected will wither, and decay, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.29, <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright. Via ad pietatem eſt intra pietatem.</hi> But for this, I refer you to what was ſpoken in the third Exerciſe, on this ſubject. Only I add, that as Natural life becomes more lively by acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even ſo are the principles of ſpiritual life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.49, <hi>Believest thou for this? Thou ſhalt ſee greater things then theſe,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> This is according to <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou haſt been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten Cities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The reality of the in-being of theſe principles in the Soul, is by this means beſt diſcerned; if ever they be ſenſibly felt, it is when they are moſt in exerciſe. When is a Man more likely to know that he hath faith, and that he hath Repentance, then when he is actually believing, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Conſider well, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 9, 11. In the fifth and ſixth verſes, he exhorts not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99371:137"/>only to add more degrees, but alſo to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thoſe principles they have received. In <hi>ver.</hi> 9. he tells them, that if they do not, they may, in all probability, in a little while, not be able to ſee any thing of God, that is ſanctifying and ſaving in their Souls; they may forget that ever they were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from their old ſins, &amp; queſtion all again. But if they add the exerciſe to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then (as <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) an entrance may be adminiſtred to them abundantly into the Kingdom of Heaven. It is worth our noting, that the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome that are far from the Kingdom of Heaven, touched with no care of Religion at all, but, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> care for nothing of that nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13; <hi>Ye who were ſometime afar of, are made nigh.</hi> Of others, that come near, but never enter, taking up with a half-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.34, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God.</hi> Of others that enter, but with great difficulty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18, <hi>And if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved</hi>—they make a hard ſhift to get thither. But others, as ye ſee, in this of <hi>Peter</hi> enter in with full Sail, triumphantly laying hold on Eternal Life. They are thoſe (though perhaps all thoſe may not) that add the exerciſe to the principle. They know in themſelves by what they find working, ſtirring, and acting in their Souls, that as it is ſaid of thoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99371:138"/>10.34,—<hi>knowing in your ſelves, that ye have in Heaven a better, and an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:</hi> that they have a right and title to Heaven, and when they dye, they go to take poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you, what I had to ſay, as to the reaſons, why we ought to exerciſe our ſelves to godlineſs, and that by this exerciſe, Soul-proſperity is promoted, and that it cannot poſſibly proſper without it. I ſhall only add two words more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the time paſt, we may, if we look back, ſee the reaſon, why though theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be of a thriving, growing nature, yet for all that, they do not proſper as they ought. It is either becauſe we deceive our ſelves, and think we have them, when there is no ſuch matter, or that we neglect the exerciſe of them, ſo as not to do that work, and bring forth thoſe fruits they were given for; but we do with them, as that ſlothful Servant did with his Talent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.18. he digged in the Earth, and hid his Lord's money: For which he received his deſerved doom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, <hi>Take the Talent from him.</hi> Profeſſing to live in the ſpirit, but walk on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Men, who have nothing but nature in them, as the Apoſtle chargeth it upon them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. This is the great reaſon, if not the only reaſon, why they thrive no more. <hi>For to him that hath (i.e.</hi> uſeth what he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99371:138"/>hath) <hi>ſhall be given,</hi> Matth. 25.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the time to come. If all that hath been ſpoken on this point, prove not like water ſpilt on the ground; if there be no cauſe to complain, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>I have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought.</hi> But that ſome good impreſſions are made, and abide upon your hearts, as I hope there do, at leaſt upon ſome; and that ye really and heartily mind your Soul-proſperity, then, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this exerciſe: And that ye may make ſomething of it, and have good ſucceſs in your endeavours, reſolve, every day, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelves to Chriſt, and pray as ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, awfully, ſincerely, affectionately, and believingly for ability to do it, as ye would do for Salvation it ſelf; for the enjoyment of him in Heaven, whom your Souls love. Even as <hi>David</hi> (or whoever it was that compoſed the 137 Pſalm) reſolved to pray for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ver. 5.6, <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. Better forget to pray for our daily bread, then for this. That's but for the well-fare of our Natural life, this is for the well-fare of our ſpiritual life.</p>
            <p>Conſider therefore.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That theſe ſpiritual principles, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ability to exerciſe them, are diſtinct mercies, and ſeparable the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as ye have heard from the inſtances
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99371:139"/>given of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for meekneſs, <hi>Job</hi> for patience, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for faith; though they abounded in the principle, yet ſometimes they came ſhort in the exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a heart, and ability to exerciſe them, is to be had from Chriſt; and from him alone, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5, <hi>For without me, ye can do nothing.</hi> We read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14. what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> engageth unto; <hi>My tongue ſhall ſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud of thy righteouſneſs:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 15. we may ſee where he looks for ſtrength to make good his engagement, <hi>O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> had it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> And he exhorts all, that when they have put on the whole armour of God, and have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace ready for exerciſe, yet then to <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Eph.</hi> 6.10, 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let this be thought on too: That though we ought to reſt upon Chriſt, for his aſſiſtance herein, as if he were to do all, and we our ſelves were to do nothing at all, yet we ought ſo to ſtir up our ſelves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our moſt ſerious thoughts, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours herein, as if no help at all were to be expected from him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who worketh in you, both to will, and to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:99371:139"/>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you (the expreſſions in the Text leading me that way) that what in a natural way is neceſſary for the health, and well-fare of the body, that, in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way, is as much neceſſary for the health, well-fare, and proſperity of the Soul. And this I have ſhewed in four Particulars. I told you, when I entred firſt upon this uſe: That when, in the uſe of theſe means, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be well within, the Soul begins to thrive and proſper. Yet it may, poſſibly, have its fainting fits; ſometimes by reaſon of continued afflictions; ſometimes from a deep ſenſe of invincible infirmities. For the more of theſe gracious principles there are in the heart, and the more they are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, the more ſad impreſſion the leaſt fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes upon the heart. No marvel if it be with ſuch as it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> when the waters compaſſed him about, and the reeds were wrapt about his head; then, he ſaid his Soul fainted within him, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. And <hi>David</hi> had like to have done ſo, when falſe witneſſes were riſen up againſt him. <hi>I had fainted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living,</hi> Pſal. 27.12, 13. Now, as when Nature is almoſt ſpent, and bodily ſtrength fails, there is need of relief by ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Cordials. As that poor Man, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.12. being faint, <hi>David</hi>'s Men gave him
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99371:140"/>ſomething, and then his ſpirits came to him, which, it ſeems, were departing from him. Now, as the Lord Jeſus was very tender over thoſe, that came from far to hear him, and had been three days with him, leſt they ſhould faint in their way homeward, and therefore he wrought a miracle to relieve them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.32. So without doubt, he is as tender to prevent Soul-fainting, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57, 15, 16,—<hi>to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth, for the ſpirit ſhould fail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and the Souls which I have made.</hi> Something therefore muſt be ſaid to this. Therefore, though I cannot deſcend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, (that would be too great a work) I ſhall only give ſome general rules, which may be indifferently applyed to all caſes. Let then every Soul that is ready to faint:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, in the place before quoted, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, <hi>My Soul fainted within, and I remembred the Lord.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance implies dependence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7, <hi>But we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> This is preſcribed for a fainting Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10, <hi>Who is among you, that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light? Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.</hi> Now we muſt know
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99371:140"/>that the Name of the Lord, may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5, 6, 7, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. This is very chearing. For a fainting Soul may ſometimes take encouragement from an Attribute of God, when he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may touch with a promiſe, or no. Or it may have reference to that name, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23, 6, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when a Soul ſeeth nothing in it ſelf whereby it can challenge any intereſt, in any ground of comfort: yet becauſe there is grace, and mercy enough in the name of God, and merit, and righteouſneſs enough in the Son of God; ſuch a Soul may ſee ground enough to reſolve, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17, <hi>I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and I will look for him.</hi> Pſal. 34.5, <hi>They looked to him, and were lightened, and their faces were not aſhamed.</hi> Though all the clouds were not preſently ſcattered, yet they had ſome light. And a little Candle in a dark room, in a very dark night, though it do not make it day, as the Sun doth, yet it is ſome reviving, till the day do appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be well conſidered, what God impoſeth upon fainting Souls, as one great part of their work, in ſuch a ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.22, <hi>Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee: he ſhall never ſuffer the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99371:141"/>righteous to be moved.</hi> When thou art ready to faint under thy burden, caſt it upon me, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</hi> Do then, as <hi>David</hi> did, he hears the command, ſpeaking in general unto all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Seek ye my face;</hi> and ſeeth himſelf concerned in it, and therefore reſolves, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek.</hi> It is obſervable, that when Chriſt commanded the blind Man to come unto him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.49, <hi>Be of good comfort,</hi> ſay thoſe that were by-ſtanders, <hi>the Maſter calls thee.</hi> Such commands, in this caſe, may ſometimes be of greater uſe then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and more effectual for the ſilencing of doubts, and diſcouragements. For the beſt are apt, when in the dark to diſpute their intereſt in the promiſes, till they have diſputed themſelves out of all heart to cloſe with them. But Commands are not to be diſputed, but obeyed: See <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.5. There was diſcouragement enough: They had fiſhed all night, and caught nothing; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, ſay they, <hi>at thy word, we will let down the Net.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Taking it for granted, that a fainting Soul, in obedience to the command of Chriſt, is willing, if able, to come to Chriſt, and to cloſe with him: And if the queſtion were put to him, as it was to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 24.58, <hi>Wilt thou go with this man?</hi> He would
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99371:141"/>anſwer, as ſhe did, <hi>I will go.</hi> And hearing the terms, whereon he promiſeth to be ours, can, and doth yield unto them, as heartily as <hi>Laban</hi> did to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, and deſire as he did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.34, <hi>I would it might be, according to thy word.</hi> Then let every fainting Soul know his right, and claim it, and know his duty upon this account, and ſet about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Know his right, and claim it. What's that? Even the promiſes of God, as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; for thoſe that yield to Chriſt's terms, are received into the number of his adopted Children, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. And if Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then Heirs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Heirs of what? See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29, <hi>And if ye be Chriſts, then are ye</hi> Abraham's <hi>Seed, and Heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> We read that <hi>Naboth</hi> would not part with his inheritance, neither for the good will, nor ill will of King <hi>Ahab.</hi> Let Souls ready to faint, do ſo in this caſe, with the Promiſes, which in Chriſt, are their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted inheritance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God, are in him, yea, and in him.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let Souls ſubject to fainting, know their duty upon this account, and ſet upon the performance of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They ought to acquaint themſelves with the promiſes. They are ſo great, and precious, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99371:142"/>that there is not one of thoſe that really cloſe with Chriſt, though they be of the loweſt form, but may find that which is moſt ſuitable to their condition, in ſome promiſe or other that is within their reach, though ſome may ſeem to be above him. Though a little Man upon low ground can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach the top of the Tree, yet he may get hold on ſome of the lower branches, and there may find ſome fruit, which may ſomewhat relieve him. As ſuppoſe, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find comfort in that promiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7, <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the Tree of Life.</hi> No, he is afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome, that promiſe is too high for him, it is above his reach; yet he may reach that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17, <hi>And let him that is athirſt, come. And whoſoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> If not that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> Yet they may reach that, ver. 6, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> And that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given unto me, ſhall come unto me: and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And let every fainting Soul know this, that ſo far as he hath an intereſt in any one promiſe, ſo far he hath an intereſt in every promiſe, as to that bleſſing in it, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. For as there
<pb facs="tcp:99371:142"/>is a chain of duties, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37, 38, 39, 40, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God—This is the firſt and great Commandment, and the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf: On theſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Not this or that; but this and that too. So there is a chain of Priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30, <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi> And a chain of Providences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God.</hi> So there is a chain of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; they are all bound together in one bundle in the Covenant. That great, and precious promiſe <hi>[I will be thy God]</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them all. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Let them plead the Promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49, <hi>Remember thy word unto thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, upon which thou hast cauſed me to hope.</hi> Eſpecially that particular promiſe, which contains that particular bleſſing, which if it were as ſure in their hand, as it is in the promiſe, the fainting Soul thinks, it would ſatisfie. Thus did <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.9, 10, 11, <hi>O God—which ſaidſt unto me, return into thy Country—Deliver me, I pray thee, from the
<pb facs="tcp:99371:143"/>hand of my Brother</hi>—Thus every fainting Soul ought to do. The promiſe is that Bond, wherein God hath made himſelf a Debtor, if not to his Covenant-people, yet to his own truth, and faithfulneſs, which requires it of him, that what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, be fulfilled, and therefore they ought to plead them. This is God's method; he expects to hear from them, before they can expect to hear from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Let them patiently wait for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of what is promiſed. If the thing be of abſolute neceſſity, it ſhall be given in kind. And ſo it ſhall be, though in it ſelf it be not, yet if God in his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſees it will be ſubſervient thereunto, and will better promote it, then the want of it will; it ſhall alſo certainly be made good. The Scripture ſpeaks as if God had promiſed us nothing, but Eternal Life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25, <hi>And this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even Eternal Life.</hi> But it is, becauſe all things abſolutely neceſſary unto Eternal Life are comprehended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Therefore wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. It's true, there may be ſilence in Heaven, and that for a great while, to the prayer of faith; as there may be a ſilence very often to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
<pb facs="tcp:99371:143"/>of the generation that is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God. But as he will ariſe in due time to execute his vindictive juſtice upon the one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21, 22. So he will ariſe to make good his promiſes of grace, and mercy to the other. For God never ſaid to the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that they ſhould ſeek him in vain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. I ſhall conclude this with that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5, <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Chriſt.</hi> He had laid down great grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for them, in the former Chapter, verſ. 13, 14. And aſſures them, verſ. 3. of this Chapter, that God was faithful, and would ſtabliſh them. They ſhould not miſcarry, nor fail of that which God had choſen them unto; but knowing the difficulty of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when expected ſupplies were delayed, eſpecially when Providences ſeem contrary to Promiſes, he prays that the Lord would direct them into the love of God, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting for Chriſt. This is the third particular, which it concerns fainting Souls to take ſpecial notice of.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Fainting Souls, or Souls often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fainting, ſhould endeavour after a diſtinct knowledge of the great, and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In the Meritorious cauſe of it, which is the obedience of Chriſt, as Mediatour, in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99371:144"/>doing, and ſuffering what God the Father appointed, and which he accepted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all thoſe, to whom it is imputed; ſo as to diſcharge them from the curſe of the Law, which they had deſerved to be executed upon them to the uttermoſt: and to accept them, as righteous unto Eternal Life, of which they were utterly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That it is God which juſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that juſtifieth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That the moving cauſe is Gods free love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) That the means of receiving it, is Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, <hi>Even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Chriſt Jeſus, unto all, and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.</hi> Theſe things being well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, are great Cordials. <hi>For whom he juſtifieth, he glorifieth,</hi> Rom. 8.30.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Let ſuch alſo think of the nature, and efficacy of Chriſts Interceſſion; and that with thought upon thought. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Heaven for us, <hi>Heb</hi> 9.24. And who thoſe are, ye find, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able alſo to ſave them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them:</hi>

            <p>I Now proceed to the third, and laſt branch of the Uſe, that hath been ſo long inſiſted upon. To exhort thoſe (if there be any ſuch, and I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope there are ſome ſuch) whoſe Souls do proſper, with whom it begins to be better, with reſpect to the frame, and temper, of the hidden Man of the heart, then it hath been: To exhort them, to give all diligence, that it may continue ſo with them: That they may not loſe the things they have wrought, but receive a full reward, 2 Epiſt. of <hi>John</hi> verſ. 8. But keep them in that holy frame, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the exerciſe of godlineſs hath brought them.</p>
            <p>But before I ſhew what in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is our duty; I ſhall premiſe five things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That an abſolute ſettlement of the Soul in the ſame highth and degree of this ſpiritual proſperity, that is by ſome attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, s rarely, if ever, preſerved for any long time together. There is a tincture of that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99371:145"/>madneſs which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.3, <hi>(yea, alſo the heart of the Sons of Men is full of evil, and madneſs is in their heart while they live.)</hi> that remains, and always will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the hearts of the beſt, when they are at beſt. <hi>Paul</hi> found it ſo, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.21, <hi>I find a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> And Mad-men ſeldom continue in any one temper, any long time together. Therefore as it is with Men in reſpect of their outward condition, though all things may proſper with them, and that for ſome conſiderable time together; as it was with <hi>Job;</hi> He had his months where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Candle of God did ſhine upon him, and the ſecret of God was upon his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle; when the Almighty was with him; when his Children were about him, <hi>Job</hi> 29.2 3, 4. But in all theſe, we know, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent a great, and ſad change; the clouds gathered upon him, and darkned all his Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine. <hi>David</hi> found it ſo; his fair weather (as we uſe to ſay) did not laſt always, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7. He thought himſelf ſetled in his Kingdom, above danger of oppoſition, but he found it otherwiſe; God was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him, hid away his face, and then ſuch troubles came upon him, as he never dream'd of. Even ſo it hath been, with moſt thriving and growing Souls, when they thought they could have ſaid, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:99371:146"/>Pſal. 108.1, <hi>O God, my heart is fixed, I will ſing, and give praiſe:</hi> Yet they have found, that even then it was with them, but as with a Ship at Anchor, which though it be not driven into the Maine, nor ſplit againſt the Rocks, yet it is often toſſed up and down, and reels to and fro. Many ſad inſtances we have of this in the Scripture, that the moſt gracious perſons have not always kept their principles of godlineſs in exerciſe, at the ſame height; no not thoſe, wherein they have been moſt eminent. Neither <hi>Abraham</hi> his Faith, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> his Meekneſs, nor <hi>Job</hi> his Patience. Even <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Faith, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his Meekneſs, and <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience, had their ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And at this day, the more any Man ſtudies his own heart, the more he will tell you, that in his own experience, he finds it ſo; for many ſuch changes are wrought by the hand of the moſt high: As in reſpect of our natural ſtate, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.2, <hi>He cometh up as a flower, and continueth not:</hi> So very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in reſpect of his ſpiritual frame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As many have experienced ſtrange, and unexpected turns of Providence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their outward condition: So no leſs ſuddenly or unexpectedly have they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced as great changes in their ſpiritual condition. There are thoſe, no doubt, can tell you, That having been brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99371:146"/>the influences of divine grace, and love, ſo as they have found much inward long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after more and more enjoyment of God, even then when they found much ſweet delight in what they did enjoy; and this joined with ſerious reſolutions, of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cloſe to God; and have thereupon hoped, that the worſt had been paſt, that it would never any more be with them, as it had been. Never ſhould they live (ſo they hoped) at ſuch a diſtance from God, as they had done; nor ſhould their hearts wander from him, as in times paſt: Yet after all this, very unexpectedly, like an inſtrument in change of weather, have they found themſelves, as we ſay, out of tune again. As thoſe that dwell by the Sea-ſide do ſee, that though the tide be now out, and it be low water, yet upon a ſudden all is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown again. Beſides experience, we have ſad inſtances of this in Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.13. Having in the words before profeſſed his aſſurance of God's preſence with him, and protection of him, he now rowſeth up his Soul, from his former damp't, and dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh condition, to a high degree of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of ſpirit, praiſing God for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the hands of <hi>Paſhur,</hi> and the reſt of his Perſecutors (before he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered) out of an hopeful expectation of it, as if he had already received it. But
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99371:147"/>how long doth this laſt? See <hi>ver.</hi> 14, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the day wherein I was born.</hi> A ſtrange alteration, and ſudden down-fall from ſuch an height of confidence in <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and ſuch a degree of comfort, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. to ſuch a low dejection of ſpirit, and ſtrange diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, as inconſiderately to curſe the day of his birth; &amp; thoſe that brought his Father the report thereof. A lively pattern this is, of the truth of that which we are ſpeaking of. An inſtance not much unlike to this we find in <hi>Elijah.</hi> Compare 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.18. where he told <hi>Ahab</hi> with ſo much reſolution; <hi>I have not troubled</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but thou, and thy Father's houſe.]</hi> with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.3. when being threat'ned by <hi>Jezebel, He aroſe, and fled for his life.</hi>] What a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change was this? He that durſt ſay to <hi>Ahab</hi>'s face, Thou, and thy Father's houſe have troubled <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that could fetch down both Fire and Water from Heaven by his prayers, that durſt command the ſlaying of 450 Prieſts of <hi>Baal:</hi> yet he ſhrinks at the threats of a Woman, and wiſheth to be rid of his life, becauſe he was afraid to loſe it. This was a ſtrange turn in that holy Man's ſpirit. But ſo it hath been, and ſo it is, that the pulſe of a ſick Man, doth not more vary, then the temper of the Soul of a ſound, and upright Man: This day, perhaps, ſome Communion with God, ſome drawings nigh
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:99371:147"/>in holy duties, ſome good hopes, through grace, of acceptance with God, unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: yet within a while, overcome again with deadneſs, and darkneſs, ſtrange flatneſs and coldneſs growing upon the face of the whole Soul again, ſo as it is nothing the ſame it was. Thus we ſee, that though the ſtate of grace be ſure, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. yet the workings of grace are variable. The nature of it is unchangeable, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it are ſubject to many changes, the operations of it to many alterations. So that though the principles of godlineſs be always like themſelves, yet the moſt godly Souls, that proſper moſt, are not always like themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As there may be ſuch a ſad, and ſudden change in the moſt proſperous Soul that lives; ſo that may be loſt in ſuch a change, which will not be recovered but with very much difficulty. A Ship may eaſily be born down the ſtream, but it is hardly fetcht up again. A Man may loſe more ſtrength in a few days ſickneſs, then can be recovered in many days. I have read of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>England,</hi> a ſober, and temperate Prince, that he ſurfeited with eating a Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey, which coſt him his life. Thus one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate meal may overthrow the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Man's whole life: for the ſame Hiſtory ſaith of that King, that he did ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99371:148"/>or never eat, but when he was hungry; or drink, but when he was thirſty, yet thus he came to his end. Thus it may be in this matter, which we are ſpeaking of. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Soul that mounts aloft, by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of grace, as upon Eagles wings, if ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drowſineſs creep by degrees upon it, and that it begins to dally with duties, or to dally with ſin, it may coſt much ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wreſtling, and ſtriving with God, much heart-humbling, and mourning in the ſight of God, before it recovers its former height, and heavenly temper. If a Watch be let fall, and receive a bruiſe, it muſt be all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſunder, before it be brought to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exactneſs, and evenneſs of motion. Read the 5 ch. of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; there ye may perceive what hard work the Church had, in ſeeking after Chriſt, before ſhe found him again: We read of <hi>David</hi>'s firſt days, as his beſt days, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. And though it may eaſily be proved that he recovered his former ſtature both in grace, and comfort: yet it may as eaſily be proved, that he found it no eaſie matter to recover either the one or the other. And this his 7 penitential Pſalms do ſufficiently prove.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet for all this, much may be done this way, ſo as a proſpering Soul may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in its proſperous ſtate; more then the
<pb facs="tcp:99371:148"/>moſt careful Man in the World can do, for the continuance of the proſperity of his worldly eſtate: A Man may be looking to, and taking care for the well managing of his eſtate, and yet whilſt his eye is upon it, he may ſee it upon the wing, and flying away from him, as the Eagle towards Heaven, far enough out of his reach. See <hi>Job</hi> 1.14. <hi>Job</hi>'s Servants with great care and diligence attended their Maſter's buſineſs, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his Cattel, and improving his ground, each of them according to their place, and yet ye know, how ſuddenly all was loſt, ſo that it came to be a Proverb, <hi>As poor as Job.</hi> But there is more certainty of God's proſpering ſerious endeavours in minding Soul-proſperity. For if the occaſions of ſin be watched againſt one day as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if the firſt riſings of ſin be checked, and ſuppreſſed; if grace be exerciſed ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Providence of the day; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in the duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be made our great buſineſs of the day, ſo far, and ſo long as it is ſo, ſo far and ſo long the Soul will continue to proſper. And why all this may not be done one day as well as another, no reaſon can be given. The promiſe of the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit for all this, is ready one day as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And God is a God hearing prayers for all this, one day as well as another. And
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:99371:149"/>therefore, what is done one day, may be done another. It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5.22. That though the age he lived in were very corrupt, yet he walked with God, and lived in ſome degree of eminency in the exerciſe of the principles of godlineſs, above others of the Servants of God, that were his contemporaries, and he had this teſtimony, the Spirit of God witneſſing, together with his Spirit, <hi>That he pleaſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. And it is well known, that the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as he began, ſo he continued, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a good fight, finiſhing his courſe, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith, and living by faith, to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, as he ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, And though his outward condition was, for the moſt part, very low, yet his ſpiritual condition was very thriving, and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; though the one periſhed daily, yet the other was renewed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our labours, and endeavours, how much ſoever we abound therein, will not be in vain, but be abundantly recompenſed, in the bleſſed fruits, and effects thereof. When a proſpering Soul is carried on with a full gale in its holy courſe, the precious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit of God, in, and by the Ordinances of God, will be fixed, and the word will be an abiding word, and not like thoſe human Ordinances, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.22. which periſh in the uſing.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:99371:149"/>And as the matter requires, the word which ye hear at one time, will be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance at another time, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. and put the Sword of the Spirit into your hands, ſo as to reſiſt the aſſaults of Satan, and diſcover a temptation in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, before the heart be enſnared by it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) To keep the heart humble, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward, under a confluence of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts. To keep it calm, and well-compoſed under all provocations from Men, and afflictions from God, ſo as to run with patience the race that is ſet before us; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on, till our courſe be finiſhed. To be much above diſtracting fears, in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; all of them being mightily ſubdued in the reverential fear, and awe of God; yea to have our thoughts of death full of comfort, and our hopes of Eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, full of well-grounded confidence: To be able to live to God, whilſt we live, and to dye to God, when we dye. Theſe, and many ſuch like, are the effects, and bleſſed conſequences of this, ſo far as it proſpers. So as all ſuch whoſe Souls do proſper, ſee cauſe daily, not only to bleſs their God, but alſo as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.16. To bleſs themſelves in their God, whatever their condition be: Therefore let not theſe conſolations of God, ſeem ſmall unto us; but engage us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as we are commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. To
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99371:150"/>keep our Souls diligently, leſt we forget the things which our eyes have ſeen, and loſe thoſe things which our hearts have wrought. Theſe things being premiſed, I proceed to the Directions, neceſſary (as I ſuppoſe) to be obſerved in this caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Souls that proſper, being through the aſſiſtance of the quickening preſence of the Spirit of God with them, well recovered out of that ſpiritual deadneſs, &amp; benummed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their hearts were ſunk into, muſt take heed of Relapſes. Sin (as ye have heard) is the Souls ſickneſs. Therefore as ye ought to take heed, that there be not any unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified root of bitterneſs in you, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. So take heed of relapſing into that ſin, or thoſe ſins, whether of Omiſſion, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whatever they were, which brought your Souls into, and kept them in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſpering, and unthriving condition; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ye groaned, and from which ye find your ſelves now, in ſome good meaſure, ſo happily recovered. Thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of a dangerous Diſeaſe, if they be not very careful, may relapſe again. And Relapſes, though they are not always mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet they are always dangerous. It is ſo with the Soul. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.18, 19, 20. we read, that out of a bile that is healed, there may ſpring up a Leproſie, a Diſeaſe far more dangerous then the former.</p>
            <pb n="285" facs="tcp:99371:150"/>
            <p>It is a ſad, but a true charge upon the Lord's profeſſing People of old, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.7. that they were bent to back-ſliding. And this proneneſs hath been, as is too often, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the act. And no marvel, for whatever is nought, and reigns in the hearts of the worſt Men, there is ſtill a remainder of it, in the beſt of Men. Now it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as that two and three make five, that if the moſt proſperous Souls be not well look't unto, according to the ſuitableneſs of the temptation, every old, ill quality will break forth again. For every thing that is natural (as all ill qualities are to the Soul, and this of relapſing, and back-ſliding, as natural as any) will return to their ſtate, if ſpecial care be not taken, to hinder it. As a ſtone that is thrown up into the Air, will fall down again, when the force of the Arm that threw it up, is ſpent: And water will have its courſe downward, when once the damm, that ſtopt it, is broken down.</p>
            <p>This particular then is neceſſary to be ſpoken to, and that ſomewhat largely, which ſhall be recompenced in ſpeaking more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto thoſe other Directions that follow. For if this be neglected, none of the reſt will be obſerved.</p>
            <p>Conſider then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That relapſing, and back-ſliding in its general nature is directly, and in a ſpecial
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:99371:151"/>manner contrary to the exerciſe of thoſe principles of godlineſs, which have the ſame influence into the health, and well-fare of the Soul, as natural heat, and radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture have into the health, and well-fare of the Body; I mean Faith, and Repentance. By the exerciſe of Faith, we come to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſhall come unto me.</hi> And by the exerciſe of Repentance, we turn unto God, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12, <hi>Turn ye unto me with all your heart.</hi> Now, relapſing and back-ſliding is a departure from God, <hi>Heb,</hi> 3.12. a drawing back, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To bring this yet more cloſely to the matter, I am ſpeaking unto, we muſt take notice, that this relapſing, or back ſliding comes under a double conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There is a relapſing or back-ſliding which proceeds from the want of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of godlineſs. This is to be charged upon thoſe that after illumination, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, having given up their Names to Chriſt, and engaged in the profeſſion of Religion: Fall firſt from the practice, and, it may be, at laſt from the very profeſſion of Religion. Firſt from all appearance of exact and circumſpect walking, to vanity, and looſneſs; and then, it may be, to open prophaneneſs, as they, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, <hi>If after they have eſcaped the polutions of the World,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:99371:151"/>through the knowledge of the Lord, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them, then the beginning.</hi> Theſe do not fall from the grace they had, but do indeed diſcover, that they never had any. For every one that hath the true principles of godlineſs in his heart, ſhall perſevere in his gracious ſtate: The Seed of God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in him, though he do not always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, in his gracious frame. The new-born Chriſtian is born a Conquerour; his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bears date from his birth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, <hi>For whoſoever is born of God, overcometh the World—and ſhall at laſt be more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> Rom. 8.37.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) There is a relapſing, and back-ſliding through weakneſs, or rather, as the truth is, for want of the exerciſe of the principles of godlineſs, whereby the heart is drawn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one way, and ſometimes another way from God.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Sometimes through violence of temptation, and the unmortified inclination of the heart, into ſome outward act of ſin, which may come under the obſervation of others, as we may ſee in <hi>Peter:</hi> ſeveral times he was ſurprized with ſelfiſh fears, which brought forth ſad effects. Once, when he tempted Chriſt, not to hazard himſelf at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> Matth. 16.21, 22, 23. This was
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99371:152"/>from his fear, leſt if it ſhould go ill with his Maſter, it would not go well with him. This appears by Chriſt's thereupon preſſing upon him, and all that would be his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the duty of Self-denyal, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Croſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. And then after that, when Chriſt was arraigned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.70. And after both theſe, we find him fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a grudging of the ſame Diſeaſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 12. So <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Diſciple was twice ſurprized, ſo far to forget himſelf, as twice to give that worſhip to the Creature, which was due to God alone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22.8. There are other groſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which (as the Apoſtle ſaith) are manifeſt works of the fleſh. It would be an aſtoniſhing thing, if any that ever were alive to God, much more if any whoſe Souls did ever proſper, ſhould back-ſlide ſo far, as into ſuch dead works: This were a high degree of quenching the Spirit; for <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16, <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the ſpirit, and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a back-ſliding through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or rather through want of exerciſe of the principles of godlineſs, into many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual evils, which no eye ſeeth, but the eye of the moſt holy God, who ſeeth all things, ſuch as ſpiritual dullneſs, and liſtleſneſs unto that which is good, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7, <hi>There is none that calleth upon
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99371:152"/>thee, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee:</hi> So as private duties are either omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Seaſon, or ſhuffled up in a ſlight, and formal manner. Though God be the object of the duty, yet the enjoyment of God is not made the end of the duty: when the heart grows vain, goes in and out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in nothing but inconſtancy, aſſuming unto it ſelf a lawleſs liberty, as if there were none to obſerve it, none to judge; eaſily drawn away to forgetfulneſs of God, ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding away, without any obſervation, from under the power of all obligations to the contrary. Relapſes of this nature, though they do not preſently make any great noiſe, in the World, yet it will not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be ſeen in ſad effects, and be diſcerned in more viſible miſcarriages. If they be indulged, they are great enemies to Soul-proſperity; and will prove the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bane, and break-neck of that thriving, and proſperous frame, the Soul was grown, or growing into. This is then ſeriouſly to be conſidered of, by all thoſe whoſe Souls begin to proſper, and when it begins to be better with them, then it hath been, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their inward frame, and temper of the hidden man of the heart; as ever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they may continue ſo, and loſe the things which they have wrought, to beware of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes. Ye have heard that ye are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99371:153"/>from them, nor exempted from a poſſibility, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, <hi>Take heed, Brethren, lest there be in any of you, an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the Living God.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid; That which I ſpeak to one, I ſpeak to another, I ſpeak to all; therefore let every one take heed.</p>
            <p>Now that which I find in Scripture preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon us, for preventing ſuch relapſes, is to have a watchful eye over, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant hand upon all the inward workings, and ſtirrings of the inward Man, for from thence they have their riſe, as ye may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in ſeveral ſorts of Trees, their decay is firſt obſerved in the withering of the boughs, but it begins in the root, which fails in ſending up ſap into them, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Even ſo it is here; which way ſoever relapſes, are diſcover'd, they begin from within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.18, <hi>Our heart is not turned back: neither have our ſteps declined from thy way.</hi> Profeſſours firſt fall from their apprehenſions of the neceſſity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect walking; their convictions of the goodneſs of the ways of God, wear off, and their affections decay: and the works of the fleſh break forth, and manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by degrees. Therefore as ever we deſire to hold faſt what we have received, be ſure to keep the heart with all diligence, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. Where,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:99371:153"/>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) Our perſonal care is required, Keep thy heart.</item>
                  <item>(2.) Our principal care, Keep it, with, or above all keeping.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As it is with the heart, naturally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, if that begin to tremble, or be in fear, or apprehenſion of danger: the blood and ſpirits (as it is obſerved) will forſake the outward parts, and run to that, to guard and ſuccour it, the leaſt wound therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mortal, if it be but with the pricking of a Pin. Thus the heart is kept in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural capacity; but the matter we are ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of, is touching the keeping of the heart in its ſpiritual capacity; and keep it we ought with all diligence; watch it by night, and by day; at home, and abroad; when we are in company, and when we are alone, at all times, and in all places; yea, as the Apoſtle preſſeth it on <hi>Timothy, Watch in all things,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.5.</p>
            <p>Now this keeping, this watching the heart, hath ſpecial reference to the inward workings, and ſtirrings of corruption.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To prevent (in the ſtrength of Chriſt) ſo far as may be prevented, in this ſtate of imperfection, the firſt riſings of them, of any one kind whatſoever; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to prevent, if poſſible (and poſſible it is) that the Corruption, and the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be kept aſunder, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99371:154"/>
               <hi>Watch, and pray, that ye enter not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Otherwiſe, there will be ſad work; and the proſperity of the Soul will begin to fade, and that upon the ſudden. Though <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as holy a Man as he was, and how much ſoever his Soul did proſper, (and proſper it did exceedingly) yet he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a root of pride in him: which though it did not ſtir him to ſhew his Treaſures to every body, yet when he fell into the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by occaſion of the viſit he had, from the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by his Ambaſſadours; then the Corruption, and the Temptation did meet, and ye may read, in the hiſtory, how much the well-fare of his Soul was prejudiced by it. So it was with <hi>David;</hi> he had, though a Man after God's own heart, the ſame root of the ſame corruption in him, yet it did not break forth, ſo as to abate any thing of his Souls proſperity, till the temptation met with it, To have his ſubjects numbred: neither had it then, if he had watched, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, to keep the temptation and the corruption aſunder. See <hi>Act.</hi> 8.20, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> The temptation was ſuitable, for <hi>Peter</hi> was out of money. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.6, <hi>Silver and gold have I none.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> was not ſo perfect, as to be beyond the power of the temptation; but he kept the temptation from mingling with what
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99371:154"/>corruption ſoever was in his heart; and ſo the gracious frame of his heart continued untoucht by it. So <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10, <hi>And the King ſaid, what have I to do with you, ye Sons of</hi> Zerviah? <hi>ſo let him curſe,</hi> &amp;c. He was ſubject to the ſame paſſions with other Men, but by the aſſiſtance (no doubt) of the Spirit of God, he kept the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the corruption aſunder; and ſo his Soul proſpered the better for that try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there ſhould be (as there is great danger there may be) a ſad meeting (ſo it is, and ſo it will be found) betwixt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the temptation, then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, that your own ſpirits may immediately riſe up in indignation, againſt it, and after ſome hearty ejaculations for the preſent, with the firſt opportunity, with hearty loathing, and inward ſelf abhorrency, bring forth the temptation, and the corruption to the law of God, and ſee them there condemned, and to the blood of Chriſt, and ſee them there pardoned; and to the ſpirit of Chriſt, that thereby all may be ſubdued, and mortified. Really, a Soul that deſires to proſper, and to continue to proſper, ſhould as kindly work in a heart-melting, and a heart-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling way, for theſe ſinful ſtirrings of the heart, before God, as for ſinful words, and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:99371:155"/>ſinful actions before Men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.22, <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant, even as a beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> It is, or ſhould be with the Soul that proſpers, as it is with the eye, if a ſmall duſt get into it, it will never leave twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and watering till it be out, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.26, <hi>Hezekiah humbled himſelf greatly for the pride of his heart.</hi> Rom. 7.24, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death.</hi> He ſpeaks of the law in his members, warring againſt the law of his mind. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. This is the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent relapſes into ſin, which is the Soul's ſickneſs, and if not prevented, or timely hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, will overthrow the proſperity of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Souls.</p>

For it is, without all controverſie, true, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and ſo, by conſequence, the growth, and increaſe of the principles of godlineſs, wherein Soul-proſperity ſpecially conſiſts, is founded upon, and preſerved by the due conſideratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">

               </gap>eing eye upon us. This is that which is ſpecially comprehended in that expreſſion of walking with God, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God. And this is as ſpecially to be obſerved, That thoſe that did ſo, whilſt they did ſo, their Souls proſpered. We have it exemplified in <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5.22. <hi>And he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. So <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6.9, <hi>Noah was a juſt Man, and perfect in his generations,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99371:156"/>and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 26.3, <hi>I have walked in thy truth.</hi> Pſal. 119.168, <hi>I have kept they precepts, and thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for all my ways are before thee.</hi> This was the beſt teſtimony, that <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son could give of him, when he was dead, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.6, <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> David <hi>my Father, great mercy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he walked before thee, in truth, and righteouſneſs, and in uprightneſs of heart with thee.</hi> This is that which God gives in charge to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, —<hi>walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> As thou deſireſt (and I know thou deſireſt) to hold faſt thine integrity: Let me live in thy thoughts, and ſee to it, that thou ſo live, ſo think, ſo ſpeak, and ſo do, as remembring thou art always in my ſight. This is that which hath a very great influence, to draw, as it were, the draught of the Image of God, day by day in our Souls, in more and more lively colours. For in the ſtate of glory, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints that are with the Lord, and always behold his face are like him, and ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. Even ſo it is in the ſtate of grace, ſo far as this duty is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly obſerved, and diſcharged, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame image, from glory to glory, even
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:99371:156"/>as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> It is true, it is not ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that his face did ſhine the firſt time, that he had been with God in the Mount, but when he had been with him the ſecond time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.29. This then is that we ought to have deeply engraven upon our hearts, as ever we deſire not to loſe the things we have wrought, to do as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before my face. [Always]</hi> that implies that we ought to make it our daily work: what a Man does every day, he is ſaid to do Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. And <hi>[Always] i. e.</hi> one day as well as another, to our laſt day. This is no more then is expreſly required, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17, <hi>Be thou in the fear of the Lord, all the day long.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17,—<hi>paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear.</hi> It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the fear of God, which hath a very great influence upon Soul-proſperity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1,—<hi>perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> And it is this realizing the preſence of God, which hath the great influence into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the fear of God. Hence it is, that true child-like fear is ſaid to be, fearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; that is, out of an awful reſpect unto, and due conſideration of his All-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.12,—<hi>it ſhall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him.</hi> This is that then, which above all other things, ought not to be omitted, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:99371:157"/>ſinews of all heart-godlineſs are, as it were, cut in ſunder, ſo far as this is neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For there is nothing left then, which hath any power over the inward man, the hidden man of the heart, but it enjoys a lawleſs liberty, as if there were none to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, nor to judge it. 3 Epiſt. of <hi>John</hi> ver. 11, <hi>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God, but he that doeth evil, hath not ſeen God.</hi> Deut. 32.18, <hi>Of the Rock that begat thee, thou art unmindful, and haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten God that formed thee.</hi> All their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs is charged upon that.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more to this Second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Direction, but only theſe Three things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That untill the Soul be ſpiritually alive to God, and ſo in a capacity of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, there is neither delight, nor deſire to entertain any thoughts of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28, <hi>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge.</hi> They caſt the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God out of their minds, as of no uſe to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts. i.e.</hi> Not in his thoughts at all, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14, <hi>They ſay to the Almighty, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> Some ſay ſo in words at length, and all of them ſay it in their hearts. Thò God ſaith, <hi>Wo unto you, when I depart from
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99371:157"/>you,</hi> Hoſ. 9.12. Yet they think it beſt when he departeth from them; and the farther the better. This frame of heart is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blackneſs of Helliſh darkneſs. It ſpeaks the very language of Satan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29, <hi>What have we to do with thee, thou Jeſus, the Son of God; art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> Thus it was of old, <hi>Iſa:</hi> 30.11, <hi>Cauſe the holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ceaſe from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Though the Soul be alive to God, yet ſo far as the Image of the old <hi>Adam</hi> is unmortified, and any particular luſt indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo far God and the heart will be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Not only the beam but even ſuch a moat in the eye, will make ſuch Souls, to ſhun, what they can, the preſence of God, and the preſence of thoſe who, they think, will ſpeak the mind of God unto them; as <hi>Ahab</hi> did the preſence of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.8. Such Souls are far from proſpering. This is the very image of old <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.8, <hi>He heard the voice of God, and hid himſelf from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Even thoſe whoſe Souls do live, and in ſome meaſure, may be ſaid to proſper, though they dare not omit any external duty of Religion, yet they do too often, and too eaſily ſlip over this, without timely obſervation, till they take a review of their hearts, and then they ſee they have
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99371:158"/>cauſe to ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.11. Unite my heart to thee, that I may fear before thee, all the day long: Or unite my heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, that it may not be diverted, or diſtracted, not carried this way, and that way, but that I may be able to ſay, It is fixed, it is fixed. Thus I ſay it is, and that too often with Souls that proſper according to their meaſure. Therefore we ought to charge our ſelves with this duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the charge from day to day. To ſet our ſelves under the actual conſideration of God's All-ſeeing eye; who hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soveraignty over us; to whom alone we muſt ſtand or fall; who can tell us all our thoughts, and will render to every Man according to his works; and therefore hath a Book of remembrance for thoſe that think upon him, and fear his name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. And hath a bag for iniquity, wherein he doth, as it were, ſeal up mens ſins to bring them forth as Evidences, and charge them upon every one as the matter requires. And as God is ſaid to have a Book, and a Bag, ſo he is ſaid to have a Bottle, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8, <hi>Put my tears into thy bottle, are they not in thy book?</hi> This, I ſay, we ſhould charge upon our hearts, and renew this charge from day to day, till we have ſome power over them. For though it be true, that God alone hath the Soveraignty over, and is the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:99371:158"/>great diſpoſer of our hearts, yet under him, we may do much. What Man is there, whoſe conſcience will not tell him, if he conſult with it, that when his heart is flat, and dead, alienated from all ſerious thoughts of the preſence of God with him, that this is his own neglect, his own willful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; for he knows that when he hath a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to manage of any conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for his outward eſtate, he can eaſily command his heart to think on it, yea and cannot put it out of his mind, when he would; ſo that <hi>The abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep,</hi> Eccl. 5.12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not neglect any longer to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that authority, which God hath given us over our hearts, if we deſire our Souls ſhould continue to proſper: We muſt ſerve him in righteouſneſs, and holineſs all our days, and every day: But all we do will come very far ſhort, not only of what it ought to be, but of what it might be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we do what we do, before him, as in his ſight, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75.</p>
            <p>Thus of the Second Direction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Spiritualize the Providences of every day: I mean, improve them to ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage; ſo as thereby ſome gracious impreſſions may be wrought upon your hearts; that thereby the duties of the day may be better performed; principles of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:99371:159"/>more ſeaſonably exerciſed; and the workings, and ſtirrings of corruption more timely checkt, and throughly mortified. This will exceedingly help (ſcarce any thing more) to preſerve the Soul in its thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and proſpering frame. Conſider then, that every day, in reſpect of the Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, it is filled up withal, is either one of thoſe two days mentioned, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. Either a day of Proſperity, or a day of Adverſity. Or elſe like that day, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.6. Neither clear, nor dark, but mixt; mercies given in, one part of the day, and croſſes taking their turn in the other. Now, it hath been experienced to be a great means of promoting and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul-proſperity, to ſpiritualize both the one, and the other.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If the day be a day of Proſperity, <hi>i. e.</hi> if no evil befalls us, but that according to the promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.7, 8, <hi>The Lord ſhall preſerve thee from evil: The Lord ſhall preſerve thy going out, and thy coming in.</hi> When God bleſſeth the beginning, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what we undertake; this hath enough in it, to raiſe up in our hearts, high thoughts of God, that he ſhould <hi>load us with benefits,</hi> Pſal. 68.19. Such as may be very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to keep us under thoſe obligations, which his bounty, and goodneſs lays upon us. Thus it wrought in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116. He
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:99371:159"/>is reckoning up the mercies of God toward him: Then <hi>ver.</hi> 5. He exalteth God in his heart: And <hi>ver.</hi> 7. His Soul retires into God, and takes up its reſt, and ſatisfaction in him alone: And <hi>ver.</hi> 9. He heightens his reſolution. Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> and thus it may be with us: Eſpecially, when the thriving proſpering Soul hath ground and reaſon enough to ſee the preſent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, of what kind ſoever they be, as having relation unto, and being pledges of Eternal mercies. This ſweetens them, and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them, how little ſoever, how common ſoever they be; that they may ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18, <hi>Who am I, and what is my father's houſe?</hi> This makes them more heart-melting, more heart-obliging, then otherwiſe they would be, or poſſibly can be to any Soul, that is either dead in ſin, or in a dying, withering, languiſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Six pence received only as a ſix pence, doth not affect the heart like that which is received as an earneſt of a greater Sum, which ſhall certainly upon ſuch a day be given to us; ſo it is here, when we can conclude, that he who kept us this day from evil, that it hath not grieved us, as <hi>Jabes</hi> prayed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.10. and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us quiet, and comfortable reſt this night; can, and certainly will keep us by his mighty power, through faith, unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99371:160"/>and this night's reſt is a pledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us of Eternal reſt, in thoſe heavenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions above, in our Father's houſe. And this concluſion, though no Man elſe can, yet thriving, and proſpering Souls may make.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the day be a day of Adverſity, a day filled up with ſad tidings, or ſad events, yet the Providences of ſuch a day may be ſpiritualized, to the ſpiritual advantage of the Soul. By a believing conſideration from what hand they come; as <hi>Job</hi> did <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi> For what cauſe? <hi>A man for the puniſhment of his ſin,</hi> Lam. 3.39. What God aims at therein, <hi>ſc.</hi> our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs. From what principle? <hi>David</hi> believed, that it was in faithfulneſs to the intereſt of his Soul, that God afflicted him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. A believing conſideration, I ſay, of theſe things, in ſuch a ſad and dark day, will conduce to preſerve the Soul in a proſpering frame: By melting down the will into the will of God, and by raiſing up the heart in the exerciſe of faith, hope, and patience; quietly to wait for ſupport under, benefit by, and, in due time, ſuch a deliverance from them all, as they ſhall be able to ſay, to the praiſe of God's free grace, truth, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> notwithſtanding all his
<pb facs="tcp:99371:160"/>troubles in his life-time, which were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther few, nor ſmall, did on his Death-bed: That the Lord delivered him from all evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the day be a mixt day, as moſt days are, ſome comforts, ſome croſſes, ſome things going for us, and ſome things againſt us; theſe parti-coloured Providences may be ſpiritualized for our Souls advantage; and be unto us as the ſide-wind to the Ship, that beſt fills all the Sails, variety of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles may be exerciſed. In ſuch a day we find enough to humble us, enough to make us thankful, and thoughtful what to render unto the Lord. That it is no worſe, That it is ſo well, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſaid, when he heard of the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Fleet in Eighty eight, whether he ſaid ſo, or no, depends upon the credit of the Hiſtorian. But I am ſure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, Lam. 3.22, <hi>It is of the Lords mercy, that we are afflicted, and not conſumed:</hi> caſt down, but not caſt off. Look to that place once again, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14, <hi>In the day of adverſity, conſider.</hi> What ſhould we conſider? Why conſider this, and mark it well, that both theſe days, with all their fillings up, are from the Lord. That it is he, who thus ſets the one againſt the other; that we may ſee that his account will be ſo balanced, that our receipts when they are
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99371:161"/>leaſt, will balance our ſufferings, when they are moſt. And that therefore we have enough to reaſon our ſelves both into a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and into a thankful frame, <hi>Job</hi> 2.9, 10, <hi>Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> And would not theſe, think ye, keep our Souls in a thriving, and proſpering frame? It would ſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beſides all theſe, we meet with daily paſſages, in what we hear, and ſee, which though they do not immediately touch us, yet may be thus ſpiritualized. Every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is a Text for our hearts to raiſe ſome Doctrines, ſome ſpiritual Meditations from. We have a Proverb, <hi>That there is never an outſide, but it hath an inſide.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it thus: There is nothing that comes under our obſervation, but there may be extracted from it, ſome inference or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to employ our thoughts about, and that to good purpoſe; even to keep our Souls in their good frame: For as a Bee can ſuck honey out of many a flower, where a flye finds no ſuch thing as wanting a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for it: So a proſpering, ſpiritualizing Soul may, and therefore ought, to endeavour to extract ſome good out of every thing; even out of its own, and other Mens failings, as we may read, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.30, 31, 32, <hi>I went by the field of the ſlothful—I looked upon it, and
<pb facs="tcp:99371:161"/>received inſtruction.</hi> Upon this ground, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, the principles of godlineſs are called, a partaking of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. For as God, according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, and wiſdom, brings light out of darkneſs; good out of evil: Even ſo may the principles of godlineſs much more, out of every good thing, though of a very mean concernment. And would not this help to preſerve it in its proſperous frame? It would ſure. That Man is like to thrive, who gains by every thing he deals in: And that Soul is like to continue to proſper, which raiſeth Earth into Heaven, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Heaven out of Earth; as every one doth, ſo far as he is faithful in the fore-mentioned particulars. And beſides, it is one of the beſt helps that I know of, to make improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that portion of our time, which runs between one ſolemn duty and another, which otherwiſe would lye upon our hands, and be rendered uſeleſs, as to Soul-concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another great work which proſpering Souls have to do, in order to the preſerving of themſelves in a proſpering frame, is this: To preſerve a deep ſenſe of their ſpiritual poverty, when it is beſt with them, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Soul-proſperity. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> from the firſt day after his converſion, to the day of his diſſolution (for ought we read,
<pb facs="tcp:99371:162"/>or have any appearance to ſuſpect to the contrary) did thrive, and proſper in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eſtate. His inward man was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daily, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. Yet what he thought of himſelf, we find by what he ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24, <hi>I find another law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind—O wretched Man, that I am—.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5, <hi>Not that we are ſufficient to think any thing as of our ſelves—.</hi> Eph. 3.8, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me who am the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—.</hi> This is as needful a direction, as any of the reſt. For it is a hard matter to ſtarve this ſin of pride, and ſelf-exalting thoughts, becauſe it will feed almoſt, upon any thing. Nothing ſo good, yea nothing ſo mean, but pride will feed upon it. <hi>Abſolom</hi> was proud of his long locks, he wore his hair ſo long, that when he polled it, it weighed about four pound in weight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.26. But I ſpeak not now of this kind of pride: but of that kind of pride, which, without ſpecial care, may breed out of thoſe excellent things, which are found in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Souls; as pride of gifts: There is the root of that pride in a proſpering Soul, which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.2, <hi>A fool hath no delight in underſtanding, but that his heart may diſcover it ſelf.</hi> Of that in the Phariſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are.</hi> Joh. 7.49, <hi>This
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:99371:162"/>people which knoweth not the law, are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Pride of Grace: Though corruption that is in the heart, hates the grace, that is in the heart, yet it is apt to be proud of it, when it is taken notice of. Grace cannot be proud: but he that hath it, may be proud of it. As <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of being lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of revelations, which were given unto him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Now, which way ſoever pride works, ye will find it like the wind, ſometimes at one door, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at another. Reſiſt it, for God reſiſteth that Man, that doth not reſiſt it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. He gives more grace to thoſe that walk humbly with him, but he reſiſts the proud, by abating, and leſſening what he had given. So far as the heart begins to be lifted up, ſo far it is naught, how good ſoever it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4, <hi>Behold, his Soul which is lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, is not upright in him.</hi> Therefore whenſoever the inward man begins to be renewed, and that it begins to be better in the frame and temper of the heart, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: Then watch, and pray that ye do not fall into this temptation. And conſider, when it is at beſt with us, how much we come ſhort of the holineſs of that rule we ought to walk by, and of the holineſs of that God which is propoſed for our pattern; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, <hi>As he which hath called you is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:99371:163"/>holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Let us compare our ſelves with that Rule, and with that Pattern, and the bright-ſhining beams of the Sun will not diſcover more motes in the Air, then the holineſs of God, and his law, would convince us of ſin to be in us. And when it is at beſt with us, would make us to ſee reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of our ſelves as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, <hi>The law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin:</hi> And to pray as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no Man living be juſtified.</hi> And in the ſtrength of Chriſt to reſolve, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14, <hi>I count not my ſelf to have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe things which are behind, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to thoſe things which are before: I preſs toward the mark—.</hi> As knowing that the Soul never proſpers ſo much, but it may proſper more; for no Man knows when he hath all the grace he ſhall have: And if we do not endeavour that we may proſper more, things will not proſper long, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18, <hi>Beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; But grow in grace—</hi>If If ye grow not, ye will fall from your ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs which ye have attained unto.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As we ſhould realize the preſence of God with us daily, and keep our Souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99371:163"/>God's eye: So put them over, and their well-fare, and proſperity into God's hands, to preſerve them. We know that <hi>Job</hi> proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in his outward eſtate, ſo long as God kept up the hedge about him, and all that he had, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.10. So it is with our Souls, They, and the gracious principles that are in them, are preſerved in, and by his hand, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 1. <hi>Sanctified by God the Father, and preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 2 Chron. 32.26, <hi>Hezekiah humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart.</hi> When <hi>David</hi>'s Soul was in a proſpering frame; ſee how he prays, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.18, <hi>O Lord God—keep this for ever in the imaginations of the thoughts of thy people—i. e.</hi> That thoſe gracious impreſſions might not wear off. It is worth our obſerving, that the Lord Jeſus knew what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts and graces the Apoſtles were to receive; yet all this would not do, if God ſhould let them go out of his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6.</p>
            <p n="6">6, And laſtly: Becauſe there will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs in obſerving this, and what other Directions ye may have from the word, whereby the well-fare of the Soul may be endangered, as by Communing with our own hearts, we ſhall find, be ſure, that ever now and then, as the matter requires, we ſet time apart for more ſerious examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, humiliation, and renewing the exerciſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99371:164"/>of repentance, faith, &amp;c. Such times are like ſcouring times, which Veſſels ſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in need of, though waſhed every day. This is the way, if there be any defect, to ſet all things right again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed you, what the work is, that proſpering Souls have to do, if they deſire (and they ought to deſire it with all their might, and all their ſtrength) that they may proſper ſtill. It is a work that never muſt be at an end, while the Soul is in the Body. I ſay no more to it, but conclude with that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12, <hi>Let him that ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> If any think that theſe Directions are too many, I ſuppoſe that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on farther conſideration, thoſe that do think ſo, may ſee reaſon to think otherwiſe: For ſo far as I can apprehend, not one of them can be ſpared; they one help another. Thoſe that underſtand nothing of a Watch, may, poſſibly, wonder, what need there ſhould be of ſo many Wheels, ſo near one another, and that they will but hinder one another; but thoſe that have underſtanding in things of this nature, do know, that one Wheel helps forward another. It is ſo here.</p>
            <p>This is all I have to ſpeak upon this branch of the Uſe. I now proceed to a few words
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99371:164"/>to each of thoſe two Caſes, mentioned the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How a Man may manage the buſineſs of his calling, and all his worldly affairs, ſo as to promote his proſperity in the World, and not prejudice, but thereby farther his Soul-proſperity?</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> 1. It is, without queſtion, not only lawful, but every Man's duty, to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his calling, and to manage it with honeſty, and integrity to his beſt advantage, that he may proſper in the World; in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe ends, for which Callings were ordained. That he may eat the labour of his hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.1. and not eat his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends, as it is ſaid of idle perſons. <hi>That with quietneſs he work, and eat his own bread,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.12. And be helpful to others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. Therefore, he ought to be diligent to know the ſtate of his flock, and to look well to his herds, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.23.24. Not to leave all to the care of his ſervants. Under this one particular, a provident care over Mens eſtates in every other Calling, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe injoined, that ſo nothing be loſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But though this be true, yet every one that deſires, that above all things, his Soul may proſper, ought not to make Religion a complement, as too many do; but his chief buſineſs. The Lord Jeſus owed, and payed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99371:165"/>reſpect, and ſubjection to his parents, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.57. Yet he declared, that he muſt attend his heavenly Father's buſineſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 49. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.38,—<hi>thy ſervant, who is devoted to thy fear.</hi> As a Scholar who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes himſelf to his ſtudy, makes learning his buſineſs: So we ought to mind this one thing as moſt neceſſary, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42. It's true, it may be with a Chriſtian that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly minds the proſperity of his Soul, as it is with Mariners at Sea, they are bound for ſuch a Coaſt, but whilſt they are ſailing, they may meet with a croſs Wind, which may drive them the quite contrary way: but as ſoon as the ſtorm is over, they recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and get into the right way, wherein they Sailed before. So a Chriſtian (one that is ſo indeed) is bound for Heaven, and the holy word of God is the Compaſs he ſails by. Yet, a contrary wind of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion blowing, he may be driven back; but he recovers himſelf again by the exerciſe of Faith, and Repentance, and ſails on conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward his heavenly Port. Thus he that minds, above all proſperities, the proſperity of his Soul, ought to make Religion his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; he is devoted unto it: <hi>To him to live is Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Both theſe being true: That every Man hath, or ought to have a Calling to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which he ought with prudence, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99371:165"/>and diligence to attend, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his outward eſtate, according to the condition, wherein God hath ſet him. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man hath, or ought to have a Calling to follow, which he ought to manage with all his heart, all his might, and all his ſtrength, as that which is for the moſt deſirable proſperity, the proſperity of his Soul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought to manage the former, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to this; God never intended them otherwiſe. Still he would have us to abide with God in our Calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. That a Man ſo drive his Trade for the World, as not to hinder his Trade for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. His home-trade within doors, his Shop, his Ware-houſe, his Working-houſe, his Oxen, or his Farm, muſt not rob his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, nor indiſpoſe him, much leſs take him off from thoſe private duties of Religion, whereby Communion between God, and his Soul, may be preſerved, and increaſed. Nor yet muſt his forreign Trade hinder him from walking as becomes the Goſpel, in all his converſe with others, but that he may, as the matter requires, ſhew forth the graces of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14, 15, <hi>Be patient to all men, not rendering evil for evil to any man, but ever follow that which is good.</hi> So far as any Man doth thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his worldly affairs, for his proſperity in the World, he ſhall not prejudice, but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99371:166"/>thereby farther his Soul-proſperity.</p>
            <p>And in order hereunto, conſider theſe few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remember that of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Pro. 28.20. <hi>Make not haste to be rich.</hi> Do not graſp more of the world into your hands, then ye may manage without diſtraction. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any more be for the proſperity of the Soul, then to eat more meat, then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of the ſtomach can well digeſt, can be for the health of the body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch a caſe, it is a mans duty, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and wiſdom to do, as the Sea-men do, when the Ship is overladen, caſt out ſome of the burden, leſt they hazard the loſs of their lives. Otherwiſe, that will be found a truth, when it may be too late to prevent it, what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich</hi> (that are ſet upon it) <hi>fall into temptations, and ſnares, and into many fooliſh, and hurtful luſts, which drown men in a Whirlpool of deſtruction and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember that though ye ought to be diligent in your calling, yet it ought to be with a holy indifferency of Spirit, not as <hi>Rachel,</hi> Gen. 30.1. <hi>Give me Children, or I dye,</hi> but as <hi>David</hi> in that great ſtrait where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>Let the Lord do with me, as it ſeemeth good in his ſight.</hi> Thus it ought to be, and thus it may be, if
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:99371:166"/>we deſire our care for proſperity in this world may not hinder the proſperity of our Souls. The ſtrongeſt, and higheſt workings both of our heads and hearts, ſhould be after our Soul concernments. Thus did <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 63.8. <hi>My Soul followeth hard after thee.</hi> 2 Sam. 6.14. <hi>David danced before the Lord, with all his might.</hi> But when a mans eyes, and his heart (as the expreſſion is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Jehojakim</hi> Jer. 22.17.) are but for the world, <hi>i. e.</hi> he doth greedily affect it, and moſt eagerly purſue it, as if that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were befallen him, which literally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel <hi>Korah,</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> the earth ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. However ſuch may hold up, and rub on, in a formal profeſſion, and that it may be with ſome ſeeming forwardneſs, yet their Souls can never proſper. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they ſhould. Therefore, <hi>labour not for that meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth to everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 6.27.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Remember this, That there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of it, upon one account, or other, that a man ſhould be as rich, as other rich men of the ſame calling. That is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary which cannot be ſupplyed, with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inſtead of it. As the light of the Sun is neceſſary for the day. All the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in the world cannot ſupply the want of that. No, it will be night, when the Sun is ſet, for all the Stars. Now, the wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:99371:167"/>and great things of the world may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by ſomething elſe; for neither mans life, nor the comforts of his life conſiſts in abundance, Luk. 12.15. ſo Pſal. 4.6, 7. <hi>There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon us, thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more then in the time, that their Corn and their Wine increaſed.</hi> But all the world cannot ſupply the want of Soul-proſperity, Matth. 16.28. <hi>What can it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul.</hi> Therefore that is the only thing neceſſary, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Remember this, That we manage the buſineſs of our calling, with a holy fear, and jealouſy, leſt we ſhould prejudice the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Souls. <hi>Job</hi> was afraid, leſt his Children, whileſt they were refreſhing their bodies, ſhould have wronged their Souls, <hi>Job</hi> 1.5. there is as much reaſon to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, in this caſe, for the world is defiling, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27. <hi>to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world.</hi> It his hard to touch Pitch, and not to be defiled. This was in the thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.15. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Remember this, That the ruling, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, chief, and principal end in labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the things of this world, ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:99371:167"/>in reference to the world to come, when <hi>David</hi> prayed for life, it was not principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he might live; but that he might live and praiſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.17.175. So in labouring after all the things of this life, we ſhould deſire them; not as ſtops, but as ſteps in our way to heaven, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly uſe them, reckoning this, though not the only, yet as one of the chiefeſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we have by them, that we have a price put into our hands, whereby we may be the more uſeful; and our light ſhine ſo much the more before Men, that they may glorify our Father, which is in heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Remember this, That it is our duty, and we ought to prepare for it, by keeping the things of the world at a diſtance from our hearts, to run the hazard of the loſs of all, when the keeping of them is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the conſcience of that duty, and ſubjection, we owe to Chriſt; when it comes to that, we ſhould ſuffer joyfully the ſpoiling of our goods, as they did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. though we ſhould go as naked out of the world, as ever we came into the world. He that will keep what he hath, in a way that God doth not approve of, may keep the thing, but he will loſe the comfort of it. Even as they, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.20. that would keep Manna beyond the time, that God allowed them, they had the Manna,
<pb facs="tcp:99371:168"/>but it did them no good; it had worms in it, and did ſtink. Thus we have ſomething toward the anſwering of that queſtion; and I do believe, that ye will find that ſo far as theſe rules are obſerved, the world will not prejudice your Souls.</p>
